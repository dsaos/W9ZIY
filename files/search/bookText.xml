 Oliver E. Lee began life in the small town of Hygiene, CO, in   THIS IS W9 ZED EYE WY, PLEASE COME IN: A MEMOIR BY OLIVER EDWARD LEE
 1920. Over the next 99 years, he would develop a passion for
 amateur  radio, serve around  the world in multiple wars as a
 RADAR and  communications expert,  raise  3 children  and
 celebrate the arrival of many grandchildren and great-grandchil-
 dren, and travel across the country extensively.

 As he prepares to celebrate his centennial birthday, we—his
 family—have compiled this memoir as a tribute to his life, his
 service to his country, and always, his passion for HAM radio.

              I suggested this collection of writings by my brother, Oliver, with the
              thought that his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren
              probably knew little of his life, particularly his early life in Longmont,
              Colorado . It commemorates his 100  birthday in June 2020 .

                We grew up in this small farming community in the 1930s . We
              lived a carefree life, roaming at will in the town and the neighboring
              farm land . Our parents were careful in their expenditures; we knew
              that there wasn’t much money for food, clothing and entertainment .
              Everyone we knew was in the same boat, so we didn’t feel poor .  There
              was always enough to eat; lots of corners were cut .

                I was seven and a half years younger than my brother and an
              absolute pest, following him everywhere . One of my earliest memories
              was his telling me, “Go tell your mother she wants you .” It didn’t do any
              good . Oliver was interested in one of the neighbor’s daughters .  When
              he visited her on the screened porch, I was there peeking to see what
              they were doing!

              assembling this book . It is a beautiful book of memories for a 100

                                The Beginning




              My mother always said I was born on the hottest day of summer: June
              21, 1920 . It was definitely the longest . Our home was a little shack down
              by the railroad tracks in Hygiene, Colorado .
                Perhaps my earliest recollection is of my father, wearing a huge
              buffalo fur overcoat and mittens, roughing me up on the bed . Our small
              frame house had a long, screened porch where we would sleep in the
              summer . Hailstorms would find me and the friendly dog, Pal, under the
              bed . Then again, all our dogs were named Pal .
                I recall finding my Christmas present in the upstairs clothes
              closet—a beautiful red wagon . I pretended I had never seen it, and sure
              enough, it turned up under the Christmas tree . One winter, I received a
              sled . My dad took me for a ride down the Hygiene beet dump—a gentle
              slope, just right for a novice sledder .

                My grandmother Billings would come down from Estes Park to visit
              in the summer, along with my two youngest aunts and uncles, who were
              only two and four years older than I .

                My grandmother Lee lived down the road a bit, and we saw her
              frequently . Grandfather Lee was one of my closest friends as I grew
              up . He allowed me to read all his pulp western magazines and gave me
              permission to read from his vast library .
                On warm summer evenings, Granddad Lee and my father would sit
              on the screened porch in rocking chairs, and I would sit in the porch
              swing listening to the drone of their voices . Both were very interested in
              current events and politics in particular . I would listen to them discuss
              local and national events and be lulled to sleep . I always woke with a

                                                                           01]]></page><page Index="12"><![CDATA[warm and happy feeling, since I knew I had my cherished magazines
            and could read about old Silver Tip and his next adventure .
              I would sometimes ask if I could stay a few days and was never
            denied my request . I would climb the big trees around the house and
            build boats to float down the irrigation supply ditch that ran in back of
            their house . I can still remember the Corn Flakes box that always sat
            on the kitchen table . We had rich, thick cream and cool milk from the
            milk house to use . There were always a couple of milk cows, chickens, a
            pig or two, and the horse left over from the horse and buggy days . I was
            allowed to laze around, and as long as I turned up for meals on time, I
            was never disciplined .

              We all seemed content to be with one another . I could ask Granddad
            a question, and he might then talk half the evening about the subject .
            I always returned home from my overnights with them in a rather
            somber mood, determined to know more about some subject I had
            heard him discuss . I look back on these times as some of the best of my
            young life .

                                Life in Hygiene




              In the years we are discussing, the 1920s, there was no running water,
              no electricity, and no indoor plumbing available to country folks . Water
              was hauled in a tank carried by a horse-drawn wagon and deposited
              in a cistern—a covered underground storage facility . Actually, it was
              usually a hole in the ground lined with rock or cement . A pipe led
              from the bottom to a hand-operated pump installed either directly
              over the cistern or sometimes in the house—ours was in the kitchen .
              By pumping vigorously on the pump handle, water would spill from
              the pump spout . In the summer it was cool and refreshing, but in the
              winter it was just a few degrees above freezing .
                I must interject an incident that has never left me . Mother once
              complained about the quality of the drinking water from the cistern, so
              Dad investigated . In the back of the pump spout, he found the skeletal
              remains of a small mouse . Evidently, we had washed its bones clean
              over the months! We used kerosene lanterns for light—poor, but if you
              don’t know any better, adequate . As for the other convenience, let’s just
              say it sat in the backyard and had a crescent moon cut in the door . On
              cold winter nights, a convenience called the chamber pot (“Thunder
              Jug” as we knew it) was slipped under the bed, so if you really had to
              go in the night, you could use this . Some were quite ornate, but plain
              or fancy, all still held the same thing . Unlucky was the one whose job it
              was to empty the pot when the beds were made!
                This was a time when radio was just being introduced to us . There
              was only one broadcast station in Denver—KOA—and when no electri-
              cal disturbances were present, you could hear people talking and music
              being played on our crystal set . One of my very first recollections is of
                                                                           03]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[having a pair of headphones placed on me and hearing strange sounds
            in the mid-1920s . Later, we had a battery-operated Atwater Kent radio
            with a loud speaker shaped like a horn that sat on top . Every evening
            we would sit around the radio—my mother sewing or reading, my dad
            smoking his pipe . With a careful selection of programs, the batteries
            would last about a month, then a new set would need to be purchased .
            I don’t expect they were very expensive, but they were considered quite
            a luxury .

              Because of the limited conveniences, our parents had decided our
            move to town was imperative, and there seemed to be some kind of
            deadline for when this had to be accomplished .

                                     A Visitor




              There was a good deal of strange activity around our little house
              between late summer and early November, 1927 . I found my mother
              making doll clothes and placing them in a large chest my father had
              made for her . She seemed pleased to be doing this, and there were
              frequent exhibitions of the chest’s contents when any of the family
              visited . I was old enough by now to realize that my life was about to
              undergo a serious change .

                One day, my mother made a most unusual request: she asked me to
              bake hot cakes for her . I was very proud of the golden brown color of
              them . Instead of eating them, though, she retired to her bedroom and
              placed them on her chest—of all places! Apparently the moist heat of
              the cakes eased the pain she had in her breasts .
                Soon thereafter, I was dispatched to my grandmother Lee’s home . It
              wasn’t long before we were blessed with my brother, Byron Albert Lee .
              I first held him wrapped tightly in a white blanket at the Longmont
              Hospital . He was small and red-faced . He slept and behaved himself…
              for the time being .
                He grew, and I grew . He occupied the high chair located in the
              center of the kitchen floor . My mother was in constant attendance . He
              developed an ear-shattering scream . He would get reprimanded for
              the outbursts—until she caught me peering in the screen door making
              terrible faces at him . So it went: he was the favorite one, and I was just
              the big old brother who could do nothing right! He was a cute little guy
              that the ladies all fussed over . I guess that never changed .




                                                                           05]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[Chapter 4:
                                  Longmont




            My parents and I lived in Hygiene until the fall of 1927 when we
            moved to the town of Longmont, Colorado .  We settled into a very
            modest four-room house with water available from a tap, electric light
            bulbs attached to a cord hanging from the ceiling, and—wonder of
            wonders—a spring in the house where all you needed to do was pull a
            chain to make water magically run .

              Alta Street was about four blocks long . It was a short extension off
            9  Avenue a few blocks west of Main Street, and was mostly occupied
             th
            by either new families just beginning their married life, or old folks
            with an empty nest . The street was lined with small four-room square
            houses . I suspect they were all built just after World War I . These houses
            originally had the necessary house in the backyard, far back and next to
            the alley, and a small shed and fenced yard for chickens . A few homes
            even had the remnants of a barn, where a milk cow or even a horse had
            once been stabled .
              The houses were heated with coal-burning ranges and “circulators,”
            as we called them . The kitchen range usually had a big, warming oven
            over the stove top, and a hot-water reservoir on one end of the monster .
            A big baking oven was underneath the firebox . It was a source of both
            heat and comfort during the winter .
              The circulator was a large rectangular device situated in a prominent
            spot along the living room wall . It had isinglass windows that showed
            the flames inside, and was usually encased in a brown steel cover that
            remained quite warm . An ash pan was built into the bottom of the stove
            that required emptying daily, causing a cloud of feather-light particles


            06]]></page><page Index="17"><![CDATA[to settle over the furniture . The ash pit sat next to the garage in the
              backyard . It was generally large enough to accommodate a season’s
              worth of coal and wood remains .
                The kitchen floors were covered with linoleum . When the pattern
              wore thin, the black base showed through . Heavy traffic areas were a
              contrast in dissimilar colors .
                The living room was covered with a carpet guaranteed to last forever .
              You had better like the color and pattern though, as it would be with
              you until death do us part .
                My mother’s younger brother, Uncle Norton, stayed with us from
              time to time . I can’t recall where he slept in that small house…probably
              in the living room on the davenport (this davenport, incidentally, was
              like the carpets on the floor: it would last a lifetime, so you had better
              like its style and fabric!) . Sometimes he and his girlfriend, Dorothy,
              would babysit me when our parents were going out for the evening—a
              very rare occasion . Dorothy would sit on his lap on a kitchen chair .
              They would hug and kiss . How disgusting! I went to bed to avoid
              looking at such a revolting display of affection .
                We always ate our meals around the kitchen table, which was the
              center of much activity . In addition to the cook stove, kitchen table,
              and some kind of cupboard for dishes and condiments, there was the
              kitchen sink . It generally sat on its own support or was fastened to the
              wall . The water and drain pipes were exposed, but were sometimes
              covered with a draw curtain around the sink, or perhaps a cabinet
              hiding the unsightly things . Most food was fried on top of the stove; the
              exception was a big beef roast or turkey baked in the oven on special
              days . Chicken? That was always fried .

                During the summer, it was too hot for the kitchen range to be used .
              We had a kerosene cook stove that was set up on the back porch—a
              sort of lean-to attached to the house . Its sides were wire screen about
              halfway down, with siding of some sort at the bottom . We frequently
              ate out there . It had a picnic atmosphere enjoyed by one and all .
                There were two bedrooms—one off the living room at the front of
              the house, the other off the kitchen next to the bathroom . My room was
              off the kitchen . It was the coziest thanks to the kitchen range sitting just
              outside the entrance . I recall being awakened one night by my mother

                                                                          07]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[hovering over me at the side of the bed . She was picking bed bugs off
            my tender little body . Apparently, they had been leaving red welts on
            my skin, so it was no surprise that they were doomed to extinction . As
            a result, the house had to be encased in a canvas shroud and fumigated .
            We went to Estes Park for the weekend, leaving the gas to asphyxiate
            any crawling, creeping, galloping varmints . It must have worked .
              Some houses had a garage: very narrow and short, barely accom-
            modating the vehicles of the early and mid-1920s . The front yards
            all displayed enormous cottonwood, elm or maple trees . Grass grew
            sparsely between the trees, the street, and the house . The streets were
            gravel and a bit dusty from passing vehicles . Sidewalks were made of
            Lyons sandstone, light red to pink in color . The cracks between the
            stones were filled with hardy growing greenery that caused them to
            heave up, leaving an uneven walkway .
              Most homes had electric lights consisting of a single bulb hanging
            from the ceiling in the center of the room . This was before the days of
            electrical appliances—there were no crock pots, coffee pots, or clothes
            irons . Power outlets were neither provided nor needed . It was a rather
            difficult task to wire an existing home for electricity: the walls were
            thick, and some houses sat almost directly on the earth, making it
            impossible to crawl under to run wires . All had water inside supplied
            from water mains running down the center of the street .
              Most homes by now had converted a closet or pantry to a bathroom .
            The flush tank sat high above the fixture on the wall . A pull chain was
            attached to a valve, and a strenuous tug tumbled the water down into
            the bowl . Sanitary disposal was via a cesspool . Not to be confused
            with a modern septic system, a cesspool was simply a large hole in the
            ground covered with boards and a layer of dirt . Hopefully, the incoming
            liquids piped from the house would percolate into the ground, never to
            be seen (or smelled!) again . This was generally successful, as much of
            this area had been an ancient lake or river bed, so sand and loose gravel
            lay a few feet under the surface dirt .

              Everyone grew a garden of sorts in the summer . The soil was dark
            and rich with compost . The mosquitoes thrived, and an occasional
            bunny rabbit helped itself to your tender greens .

              walls were lined with sandstone, but more often than not, they were just
              dirt smoothed down by the shovel that had dug the hole . One side held
              a few shelves made of heavy planks to support the results of autumn’s
              labors: canned peaches, pears, raspberries, cherries, and lots of jams
              and jellies . You’d also find a couple baskets of apples, a hundred-pound
              sack of potatoes, and a five-gallon crock of pickles . Sometimes it was
              a refuge for squash and green tomatoes wrapped in newspaper . These
              tomatoes would often last long enough to appear in a salad on the
              Thanksgiving table . An occasional mother mouse would set up house-
              keeping in a secluded corner . All was right with the world with all that
              good food awaiting you .
                The old outhouse still stood in the backyard in all its majesty, but it
              went unused . I had approval to modify it and find some purpose for its
              existence, so I covered the seats with scrap lumber . This helped a bit,
              but the building still emitted an offensive odor on hot summer days .
              Nevertheless, it became my workshop and hideout . I dug a cave in front
              of the entrance door, but it was a bit too close to the cesspool, so it also
              had a rank odor . I housed white mice in the cave, but they habitually
              escaped .
                My daylight hours were spent playing games: Pump-Pump-Pull-
              Away, Run Sheep Run, Hide and Seek, Kick the Can, and Stick Ball . I
              especially liked Shinny, a hockey game played with curved sticks and a
              Carnation Condensed Milk can . I built race cars with the unused baby
              buggy wheels, flew kites, went to the Saturday-afternoon matinees, and
              played a multitude of other kid games .
                For some reason, I thought I needed a rabbit . It might have been
              because other kids had them . Some rabbits were raised to supplement
              the daily diet; others were raised just for fun .
                Across the street on 9  Avenue lived the Collins family:
                                   th
              Grandmother Lee’s tall, undernourished brother with a protruding
              Adam’s apple, a really mean wife, and two or more sons who were con-
              stantly in trouble . The wife raised rabbits for the dinner table . I asked
              her to sell me one, which she did for a quarter . It was sort of spindly, but
              it was alive . I had built a rabbit hutch with a chicken-wire floor so the
              bunnies wouldn’t fall out easily . I cleaned the hutch every day and put

            frequent trip—but when we got home, my pet was gone .
              I searched and asked the neighbors . One told me that Mrs . Collins
            had taken it away, so I went over and looked in her cages . Sure enough,
            my nice fat rabbit was in there . I removed it and brought it back to its
            rightful home . The following day, I was out in front of our house when
            one of Mrs . Collins’s sons accosted me . He threw me to the ground
            and pounded the daylights out of me . I was screaming to high heaven,
            hanging onto one of his arms . Thankfully, Uncle Norton was home . He
            apparently looked out to see what all the fuss was about . He ran from
            the house and grabbed the kid by his ear . He whirled him around and
            around like a sack of grain! When he let go, the kid slammed up against
            a tree . My head was numb from all the pounding, but not so numb
            that I couldn’t tell this guy, “You’re messing with the wrong kid!” Uncle
            Norton went back in the house without uttering one single word . Saved
            by one of the Knights of the Round Table!
              In 1929, we moved east
            of downtown Longmont
            to 513 Baker Street, a
            two-bedroom house with
            twice the square footage
            of our Alta Street house .
            Our Baker Street home
            was on the wrong side of
            the railroad tracks, but that   513 Baker Street, Longmont, Colorado, 1940s. Oliver’s
            didn’t bother us any . Just   home from 1929-1939.    −Byron Lee photo collection
            north of a large field across
            the street was the Catholic nunnery (if that’s a word) . We used to sneak
            up there and try to peek in a window, but the walls were too high and
            too well-covered . Whatever fun and games went on inside were left to
            our imagination . Frequently, I would see a priest walk up our alley to
            go pray over a nun—literally . My mother was always frightened of them
            because of their religious apparel . Just further north was Bryant Grade
            School where both Byron and I went to primary grades .

                                  School Days




              My mother started me at school long
              before I was mentally prepared . It was all
              a complete mystery to me! A very kind
              neighbor lady was my first-grade teacher .
              She was very patient, but in spite of her
              best efforts, I learned absolutely nothing .
              My second and third grades were similarly
              fathomless; until finally, my third-grade
              teacher bit the bullet and held me back a
              year . She kept me after school many times,
              trying to help me read and do my ciphers .
              I had no clue .
                I missed the first six weeks of the fourth
              or fifth grade due to a burst appendix that
              kept me home and in bed . During this   Oliver Edward Lee, age 6,
                                                     Longmont, Colorado, 1926.
              time, I was lucky enough to have a grown        −Byron Lee photo collection
              son of a neighbor blessed with a wonderful
              library . He had a room full of Tom Swift books that contained many
              exciting adventures: Tom Swift and His Flying Machine, Tom Swift and
              His Racer, and many others . Tom never met an obstacle he couldn’t
              conquer!
                Thanks to “Tom,” I began to read at about age 10, and it just came
              naturally . I was under no pressure to perform; it was easy . My grandfa-
              ther Lee also had many exciting westerns he shared with me . However,
              when I returned to school, I was still relegated to the back of the
              classroom to do pretty much whatever I pleased .
                                                                           11]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[I managed to get into plenty of trouble . I spent one whole semester
            locked in “The Tower,” a small, round room whose windows overlooked
            the playground . I had filled a water gun full of ink . In the olden days,
            each desk had an inkwell for dipping your pen during penmanship
            practice . Some smart-ass who was always teasing me opened his
            mouth one too many times—pow! squirt, squirt. A face full of black ink
            splashed all over his clean white shirt, in his ears, and up his nose .

              Meanwhile, I was reading more and more, courtesy of my grandfa-
            ther Lee’s magazines and books . I wasn’t going to let the teacher know
            I had figured this out . Why make her life any easier when she wasn’t
            paying any attention to me anyway, stuck way back there in the back
            row? The public education system and I were locked in battle .
              In spite of all odds, my teachers passed me into the seventh grade,
            where my reputation must have preceded me . I was either in the very
            front seat under the teacher’s unrelenting gaze, or in the back of the
            classroom out of sight . Regardless, my brain cells were evolving into a
            more complex form .
              I have to admit, I probably wasn’t all that cooperative . But all that
            changed later, when I actually had a teacher who encouraged me to do
            more than show how fast I could add a string of numbers . I read every-
            thing I could find . I attacked the local library, thinking I would read
            every book on the shelf . That wasn’t a realistic goal; there is a whole lot
            of junk out there .

              About this time, I managed to develop a serious kidney disease
            called Bright’s Disease . I went to the doctor for a urine test every day
            after school for at least a year . The results were consistently poor . I was
            on a diet of yeast cakes, white meat, and no eggs, for forever it seemed .
            Finally, I either overcame it or was dismissed as incurable—I’m still not
            sure which . I remember the doctor telling my father that there was no
            need to worry about me being drafted as I would never, ever, ever be
            able to pass the physical exam . Little did he know!
              While most of the boys in my class were playing ball, I was studying
            my textbooks, doing my homework and thinking about my “radio”
            obsession .
              I took all the math courses offered by our high school . I loved trigo-
            nometry, algebra, geometry, physics, and chemistry . Everything seemed

            12]]></page><page Index="23"><![CDATA[so logical and in its place; there was no half-right answer, it was either
              right or wrong . These were the days of the slide rule, which dominated
              the classroom . Of course, you had to have one, and I didn’t! All my
              calculations were done with a yellow-lined pad and a No . 2 pencil . My
              instructors were overjoyed to have a student who actually appreciated
              their efforts .
                I was torn between taking Latin or Spanish as a second language .
              The deciding factor was the composition of the class—there were
              more pretty girls in the Spanish class . I studied my textbook day and
              night . I read Don Quixote from cover to cover and a Spanish-language
              newspaper published weekly . When I went to class, I spoke nothing but
              Spanish from the moment I entered the door until I left at the end of
              the period . My teacher recommended me as the school representative
              for scholarship tests given by various colleges . I was rewarded with
              good grades and an appreciation of the language .
                My physics and chemistry teacher was a mild-mannered little man
              who did his very best to control an unruly class . I was fascinated with
              how elements combined to make something entirely new, and thought
              a career in chemistry would be exciting .
                My physics class included many experiments in the laws of physics
              and other exciting phenomena . It was one of my best subjects . Since
              I had obtained a ham radio license and built a radio transmitter and
              receiver about this time, I was allowed to bring it to class for a demon-
              stration . This was easier said than done . A friend helped me remove
              the large chassis from its mounting rack . My dad hauled it all to school .
              We carted it up two long flights of stairs and set it all up . We strung an
              antenna next to the school building in the trees . My cousin Jim Goss
              was standing by to receive our signal . It all worked out well as other
              “Hams” joined in our conversations . From then on, I coasted through
              physics classes!
                It wasn’t all good, though . I was a poor student in my music classes .
              I should have done better, as music is a mathematical process, but I
              just wasn’t interested . My English classes suffered for one reason or
              another . I was never good at diagramming sentences . It seemed that
              this was a necessary evil, but I didn’t know why . I sat in the back of the
              room waiting for the bell to ring . I did well in study hall, as the library


                                                                           13]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[was part of this class . Sometimes I wrote and received notes from my
            girlfriends . Mostly I daydreamed through my senior year .
              Our school would frequently have some kind of sponsored dance .
            Many of the boys showed up, including me, and sat along the wall on
            bleachers . It would have taken divine intervention to get us to dance
            with a girl . We all wanted to, but none of us knew our right foot from
            the left . I finally picked out a likely young lady that had caught my
            eye . She had black hair, dark eyes and a nice smile . She was at least
            one grade junior to me, the big senior . I asked her if she would show
            me how to do this stuff . We used her kitchen floor to practice . After
            all, living-room carpets are tough to slide old tennies around on . Her
            family was even poorer than my own, so she only had one good dress
            that had to do for every social event .
              Our dance lessons blossomed into a high-school romance . I was
            never a very accomplished dancer . I mostly went because that was
            where the girls were . I took her on dates to the movies . She rode on
            the bar of my bicycle . We thought nothing of it—everyone else did the
            same . After Pal Night at the movie, (25 cents plus another penny for
            your date) we would go to George’s Candy Kitchen and share a Tin
            Roof sundae for ten cents, or split a soda . I was on short rations, as the
            only steady income I had was washing the dinner dishes for my mother
            for 25 cents a week, but if I saved some of my summer farm wages, I
            could squeak by pretty well .
              We shared our first kiss together . We shared family dinners and visits
            to Grandmother Billings, Grandmother Lee, Cousin Jim Goss’s radio
            room, football games, ice skating, summer bicycling, and whatever else
            young people did . We even spoke of marriage, but that would have been
            a long, long way in the future .
              I graduated from high school in 1938 . You have seen the yearbooks
            each graduating class publishes . All the extracurricular activities listed
            under each student’s picture makes an impressive sight . My picture had
            my name under it along with only one credit: “Member of the National
            Honor Society .” I had maintained a 4 .0 or “A” average, as it was called
            then, for at least three years, and maybe four, in all my subjects, except
            the cursed English, music and physical education . I missed being the

                Upon graduation, I pictured myself loitering on the sandy beach

              Electric shop, where I learned many things that would benefit me in
              later life .

                             Life in the 1930s




            Before I get off into the maze of “radio,” I want to give you a flavor of
            living in the 1930s . No one we knew had any money . Jobs were non-ex-
            istent . People who lived on farms were pretty close to self-sufficient,
            except that they didn’t have two coins to rub together in their pocket .
            Farm products were bartered at the local grocery store for items that
            were not otherwise obtainable . We wore patched clothes and shoes with
            run-over heels and holes in the soles . Haircuts were rendered with a
            hand-powered clipper that really pulled at your hair . Scissors were, for
            the most part, dull .
              A weekly bath consisted of hauling in a big galvanized tub from
            the back porch . It was placed on the kitchen floor near the range and
            filled with warm water . The youngest were bathed first, followed by the
            adults . No, the water was not changed between baths; everyone used
            the same water . By the end of the session, it must have been a bit murky .
            The soap was a lye soap made by the housewife and used for every sort
            of cleaning: ears, feet, hair, floors, clothing, and even the dogs—if you
            could catch them .
              Clothes washing day was a monumental undertaking, considering
            that it wasn’t done during the winter . An exception might have been
            made using a scrubbing or “washboard,” which was inserted in a bucket
            of water and the clothing systematically worn up and down on the
            rough board to loosen the grit and grime . Aunt Jennie, however, had a
            hand-powered washer . It had a long handle on one side, and by vigor-
            ously pumping it back and forth, the agitator spun the clothes around .
            When Cousin Jim was somewhat older, he rigged a small gasoline-pow-
            ered engine to the machine which spun the agitator even more quickly .
            16]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[The machine sat under a lean-to just outside . There was an old stove
              nearby that was fired up to heat huge kettles of water . The machine and
              the rinse tubs were filled and the clothes were piled in .
                You knew spring had arrived when you saw a dozen or more
              overalls, long-handle underwear, and many mismatched socks hung on
              the barbed-wire fence around the house . Next came the flannel sheets
              we had slept on all winter . They were so stiff and greasy that they were
              fit for nothing but rags after washing had removed the sizing from
              them . When the water grew murky and muddy, we’d pull the plug in
              the bottom of the wash tub so the dirt remaining in the bottom would
              be washed out . Fresh hot water and a bar of lye soap were added to
              commence the routine all over again . Wash day was not a casual under-
              taking . It was hard work, especially running the hand-operated wringer
              that squeezed some of the water out .
                Next came carrying the washed items to the fence and catching them
              on the barbs of the wire where they would dry in the breeze . When the
              clothes were dry and ready to be harvested, they were so stiff and hard
              you could barely bend them . They were clean, however, and ready for
              spring and summer work .
                I received a new bicycle for my 10  birthday, so was now wheel-born
                                              th
              if not air-born . The road between Longmont and the Goss farm was a
              narrow, gravel-covered trail . It ran through farm land ripe with alfalfa,
              corn, wheat and an occasional farmhouse . It was about seven miles
              between our homes and one that I sailed along on summer days when I
              had permission to spend a few days on the farm .
                From the main road, you
              turned down a short lane
              toward the Goss house .
              Along the east side of the
              lane was an apple orchard
              occupying about a quarter
              of an acre of land, and their
              house was located across   Aunt Jenny Lee Goss and her roadside stand,
              from there . Out in front,   Hygiene, Colorado, July 27, 1938

            was actually all the real coin they had for some years . It also financed
            their annual trips to Ft . Wayne to see their son Wesley and family . She
            would allow Jim and I to have one soda pop per day (might as well give
            us one, rather than have us swipe one!) . I generally chose a Cream Soda
            or Grape . A cousin, Dorothy Keefauver, who was my age, sometimes
            tended the stand for Jennie .

              The farm provided ice for cooling the soft drinks and preserving
            produce in an “ice box .” Birch Lake occupied part of the farm . It was a
            quarter of a mile or so south of the house, providing fish in the summer
            and ice in the winter . In about January, when the ice was its thickest,
            Uncle Percy would hitch a team of horses to a large wooden sled and
            take along an ice saw, ax and ice tongs from the shop . We would build
            a big fire on the edge of the lake to warm us, then chop a hole in the ice
            with the ax . The saw was then inserted in the hole . We worked the saw
            up and down until a long cut was made in the ice . Another parallel cut
            was made a couple of feet away from the first . With pick or ax we then
            cut this piece of ice into fifty-pound chunks . The ice was generally up to
            a foot thick and very clear and clean looking . We removed the ice from
            the water with the ice tongs and loaded it onto the sled . When the sled
            was loaded, we then hauled it back to the ice house . The ice house sat
            just south of the main house and in front of the outhouse so was handy
            to get to in the summer . Fresh sawdust and wood chips were packed
            around the ice cakes . Another layer of ice and more sawdust eventually
            filled the ice house to a level of perhaps ten feet . It was a cool hideaway
            in the summer . It provided ice for the Fourth of July ice cream social
            and all the cooling that was needed for the milk, cream, butter and
            freshly slaughtered meat that was used in the summer . This fifty-pound
            supply of ice would last from one harvest to the next, but might have
            been reduced to half its original weight by then .
              To the left of the main house stood a root cellar, a granary, and the
            main barn with a silo just to the east of it . These buildings bordered a
            field of perhaps twenty acres where Percy grew corn, wheat and alfalfa
            in alternating years . For many years they farmed with horses before
            finally becoming mechanized in the late 1930s .
              While they were farming with horses, they always took a week or
            more off from work and went to Wyoming to fish . Uncle Charlie Goss,
            18]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[who lived a short distance away, would do the chores for them . When I
              accompanied them, we would pitch a tent alongside a clear, fast moving
              stream of water . Aunt Jennie would bring her sewing and reading . She
              also had prepared many pounds of fried chicken, bread and cookies to
              feed us . We would spend the day fishing and generally have enough fish
              to make a fine feast by the time it got dark . We would sit around the
              campfire and Percy would tell us about his life as a young man .

                When they switched from horses to tractors, our trips to Wyoming
              became shorter and fewer, only to cease altogether . So much for
              modern farming methods . The old tractors were always breaking down .
              They were late with plowing, cultivating and harvesting .

                When I was in high school, Jim would sometimes come to Longmont
              and stay the night (but not until his chores were done) . We would go to
              the midnight movie on Saturday night for ten cents . It would generally
              be one with Eddie Cantor, Charlie Chaplin, or Laurel and Hardy . We
              would walk the few blocks home in the middle of the street as there
              were no street lights and the sandstone sidewalks were very uneven . Jim
              could seldom be spared from the farm chores, so he had little opportu-
              nity to get far from home .
                Chores had to be done twice a day . For us, that meant milking and
              feeding the cows . Jim and I were generally up quite late so we were
              sleeping soundly when Percy would call, “Oh Jim!” as he headed for
              the barn about daylight . In the winter we slowly stuck a toe out to
              test the air . It was always very crisp—there was no heat in the upstairs
              bedroom . We slept in our long handles and socks between flannel
              sheets . By spring the sheets assumed the universal color—gray, dark
              gray—where our bodies lay .
                In the summer we slept outside in a hay wagon . About the first of
              June we would move the bed to the wagon parked beneath the lean-to .
              We had birds, mosquitoes, spiders and other creatures for companions .
              Reveille came even earlier in the summer . The stock had to be watered
              and fed, the cows needed to be milked, and eggs gathered . The ten
              gallon milk cans were set in the ditch to cool . Breakfast was generally
              between 7 and 8 a .m . It was a substantial meal designed to last until
              noon .




                                                                           19]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[Some of the milk was run through a separator . This was a Buck
            Rogers looking machine that stood some five feet high . It separated
            the milk from the cream by centrifugal force . The cream was so thick
            and rich it would hardly pour . We used to sprinkle a little sugar on hot
            cakes then cover them with thick cream . What a treat! Milk was kept in
            ten gallon milk cans . Every other day, one or more cans were set by the
            road . The milk trunk would pick the cans up and leave some empties .

              There were never any truly idle days on the farm unless the weather
            was just too foul to be outside . Aunt Jennie read a great deal and Uncle
            Percy would work in his shop . Jim and I would retire to our “lab-or-
            a-tory” and conjure up sparks and flashes that would dim the house

            lights .

                           Cousin Jim and Our

                       Discovery of Ham Radio





              An ancient axiom says, “We can choose our friends, but are stuck with
              our relatives,” or close enough . I was fortunate enough to not only have
              a cousin, but a friend also .

                About the time I reached the 7  grade, I began to spend time with
                                           th
              my cousin Jim Goss . He was four years older than I and, of course, a
              whole lot smarter too . He was the youngest son of Aunt Jennie Lee
              Goss .

                Since radio was a fascination to both of us, we spent hours together
              experimenting with batteries, ringers, light bulbs and any other
              device or gadget we could rig up . He was old enough to provide some
              structure to our labors and could also come up with a spare silver dollar
              now and then when they sold a calf or a dozen eggs off their farm .
                Jim lived on a farm just outside of Hygiene and I lived in Longmont,
              so we had lots of telephone conversations during the week . I generally
              spent my weekends at the farm where we plotted out next week’s
              experiments and activities .
                The Goss farm had a wonderfully glorious, mysterious light plant
              that supplied electricity for the house and workshop . In a cellar
              under the house there was a huge bank of glass cell storage batteries .
              Considering they were filled with battery acid and lined with lead
              plates, I suspect that they were very heavy . Each cell was the storage
              receptacle for two huge volts of electricity . They were hooked in series



                                                                           21]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[until 32 volts were available . A small gasoline-powered engine and
            generator sat outside and was run frequently to recharge the batteries .
              Inside the farmhouse was a radio occupying a prominent place in
            the dining room . Every evening at 9 PM, we tuned into KOA Denver at
            850 on the radio dial . “Amos and Andy” was a daily ritual for everyone,
            everywhere . We listened to The Little Theater Off Times Square, The
            Phantom and many others . Imagination was an integral part of the
            listening; you needed to actually think about what was going on . I
            remember hearing Rudy Vallee sing . Don Ameche was a regular, while
            Fibber McGee and Molly were later attractions . We could hear the
            World Series and always the farm report . We all sat near the little stove
            and strained to hear every word . If we stayed up too late, the light bulbs
            grew dimmer and the radio tended to get weaker and weaker . Next day,
            it was back to the generator to charge up for the evening’s activities .
              Around this time, probably when I was ten years old and Jim was
            fourteen, the U .S . government decreed all the country would be elec-
            trified . The Rural Electrification Administration was formed by the
            President and Congress . Its goal was to build electric transmission lines
            to every farm and hamlet in the whole country . Poles were erected and
            wires strung . Electric generating plants were built and brought online .
            If we could have viewed the country from the air, we would have seen
            thousands of points of light after sundown . This was a mixed blessing .
            The availability of this unharnessed energy was available to every
            housewife and every working man . It slowly brought an end to the
            small world each family knew . The intimacy we shared by being totally
            independent of outside forces gradually came to an end . We were tied
            by this umbilical cord to some distant source of energy . Every farm,
            home, barn and shop now had this magic power .
              By this time, Uncle Norton Billings was in his mid-twenties and
            married . He and a partner had started an electrical shop where they
            sold appliances, and most importantly, new radios that ran off of 100
            volt AC supplied by the Rural Electrification Administration .

              Norton was an electrician who helped wire a good deal of Boulder
            County farms and homes to the new power grid . When a home had
            this magic power available, the first thing they wanted was a new radio .
            Uncle Nort took the old battery-operated sets in trade when new radios


            22]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[were purchased . He, in turn, allowed me to pick over the scrap pile and
              take all—or at least most—of the old radios home with me .
                What a treasure we had—a multitude of beautifully engineered
              radio receivers . Black Bakelite panels, beautifully wound copper coils
              inside, and variable capacitors made from choice material . There were
              all manner of meters and loud speakers, hardware, and handcrafted
              cabinets that were never to be found after this era . I was in absolute
              electronic heaven .
                This was the beginning of our abiding interest in “radio,” as every-
              thing electronic was called in those days . Jim and I hauled these old sets
              home by the car-full . Each set was inspected and evaluated as to what
              best to do with it . We dismantled many and began to use the parts to
              build our own versions of radio receivers and devices of many kinds,
              some of which we had no idea what they might do .

                Jim had converted one of his family’s upstairs bedrooms into his
              workshop . We had a small work bench, a wood-burning stove, a couple
              of chairs, and a multitude of radio parts salvaged from Uncle Norton’s
              trade-ins .
                During the 1930s, there were practically no books or magazines
              covering “radio,” so we blindly followed our best guess . We eventually
              found an organization—The American Radio Relay League—that
              catered to radio amateurs . From them, we bought our first printed
              material concerning the building of radio receivers and transmitters .
              The ARRL, as they were known, published a Radio Amateurs License
              Manual . We managed to procure two copies, which we studied and
              memorized . There were questions on every aspect of “radio .” You
              needed to be able to draw schematics of circuits, figure out component
              values, and know the laws concerning radio communications . The real
              sticking point was the need to be able to send and receive Morse code at
              ten words per minute . Let me tell you: learning Morse code with a door
              bell and a switch is a difficult task!
                We studied and studied . Every time we were together, we practiced
              sending and receiving Morse code . We talked frequently over the
              telephone for hours at a time: what to do with a certain component,
              how to figure what size of resistor to use somewhere, or how to measure
              voltage without getting ourselves killed .

                                                                           23]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[Between our study time and going to school, Jim and I gradually
            taught ourselves enough about electronics to build some shortwave
            radio receivers . We listened day and night to radio broadcasts—some
            even in foreign languages . When we discovered these, we figured we
            really had done something special . On a good many school days, I
            could hardly drag myself out of bed because of the late-night listening .
              After a year or so of just listening, we discovered we could actually
            talk to other people over a radio set, having heard other people doing
            this with our own two ears . We kept a sharp ear out for these signals,
            and finally discovered a few of these exceptional people around the
            Denver area .

              We discovered there were already licensed radio amateurs, or
            “Hams .” Aunt Jennie would drive us to their homes, sometimes as far
            away as Denver . We would gaze with wonder at their radio shacks—lots
            of radio tubes all glowing; big racks of equipment holding all sorts of
            exotic parts and huge amounts of antenna wire running between the
            trees . You almost needed to live on a farm to have sufficient room!
              The radio equipment was generally in a large rack six feet in height
            by thirty inches in width . I think that had something to do with a
            standard cut of Bakelite panel material . Meters galore, flashing lights,
            dials, and the smell of corona in the air . We were invigorated and beside
            ourselves with the desire to join the elite . We were a pair of self-edu-
            cated radio enthusiasts .

              We found we could do the same thing if we could pass a written test
            administered by the Federal Communications Commission in Denver .
            We obtained the necessary study material and actually memorized
            every detail in it . In addition to the questions on electronic circuits, we
            had to know laws governing the operation of a station and, worst of all,
            become proficient in sending and receiving Morse code at the speed
            of twelve words per minute . While that doesn’t sound very fast, it was
            almost impossible for us . We had a buzzer and a sending key made of a
            Prince Albert tobacco tin, and of course, the ever present battery to run
            the works . We studied, memorized and quizzed one another for over a
            year before we felt we were ready to take on the government .
              The fateful day came on a Saturday morning in early February,
            when my father agreed to take us to Denver . Wouldn’t you know it!

            24]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[It snowed all night and was miserably cold the next morning . I had
              stayed with Jim on Friday night, reviewing and talking over the plan .
              My father was supposed to pick us up before 9 a .m ., but he was late . We
              nearly died a thousand deaths, but finally we saw him coming in his
              Model A Ford pickup with plenty of clearance and chains on the back .
              I hardly remember the trip to Denver, but we did arrive in time for the
              examination .

                Our first examination was to demonstrate our ability in Morse code .
              If you couldn’t pass that, you were not allowed to take the written
              portion of the test . Fortunately, we had that down pat, and I expect we
              could have copied the message in our sleep; we had drilled ourselves so
              well for it, it wasn’t a surprise when we passed . What a relief!
                The next portion was the really nerve-wracking part . We had to
              draw various schematics of electronic circuitry and do a few algebra
              problems to solve current flow and voltage values . Fortunately, the
              written test followed our study material closely, and we breezed through
              that as well .
                Now came the long, long wait for the results of our exams . I fre-
              quently waited for the mail at our home on Baker Street . One Saturday
              morning during the spring of the year, the mailman delivered a small
              envelope with an FCC return address in the corner . Inside was my first
              Amateur Radio Operator and Station License, W9ZIY . I excitedly called
              Jim, who had just received his license as well: W9ZIX . Amazing!

                The year was 1935 . I was 14 going on 15, and Jim was 19 . As soon as
              our licenses were received, we were on the air constantly, talking to new
              friends all over the United States . I have no idea how many hours of
              sleep we forfeited to this hobby, but it must have been many .

                We remained “Zed Eye Ex” and “Zed Eye Wy” for many, many years .
              As I moved around the world, I held many different calls, but none held
              the treasured memories of that first one .













                                                                           25]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[Chapter 8:
                     Connecting To the World




            Many people were fascinated by radio and held those of us in-the-know
            in awe . Shortly after I first put my station on the air, the local police did
            the same . They said they could “copy” me on their police radio just fine;
            luckily, no one objected to the interference!
              The shop in the farmhouse was turned into Jim’s radio room . We had
            been building apparatus for a year or more in anticipation of receiving
            our licenses . There was no such thing as a commercially available piece
            of Ham radio equipment . I can recall most vividly our first radio circuit
            that actually, really worked . We were experimenting with tubes and
            oscillator circuits . We had this device on the workbench, tuned up and
            obviously working as the tube was glowing vigorously . A flash light bulb
            (attached to a single loop of wire held near the coils of the oscillator)
            would glow if there were a signal being generated—and wow, our bulb
            glowed brightly . We had finally discovered the touchstone of radio
            signals .
              From then on, there was no holding us back . Jim was a marvel
            of ingenuity . When he commenced building his radio transmitter,
            he manufactured all the variable capacitors from scraps of metal .
            Ordinarily, these would have been quite expensive for us to purchase .
            So, we wound some of our own power transformers from old trans-
            former cores and rolls of varnished copper wire . It’s a wonder we didn’t
            electrocute ourselves! We had homemade measuring instruments, but
            never any way to calibrate them . We knew these things worked, but not
            exactly how well they worked . We sometimes made our own resistors
            using resistance wires wound on a Bakelite core . Other times we slid
            a connector along a carbon rod until we got the proper resistance for
            26]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[a circuit . The vacuum tubes we used were salvaged from the old radio
              sets along with some of the meters for our front panels . It was a sight to
              behold to see all our tubes glow in the darkened room!
                We managed to get our hands on some line transformers from the
              power company . These transformers were mounted on the power poles
              and stepped down the high transmission line voltage to 110 volts for
              household use . By hooking them up in reverse, we could step the 110
              volts up to over a thousand volts to use on our radio equipment . The
              bigger spark we could draw, the higher the voltage . The good Lord
              certainly must have been looking out for us .

                We were now able to communicate with one another via radio
              rather than telephone . We must have spent hours and hours on the
              air discussing how to do this or that . There were a scattering of other
              Hams around the area . We would join one another on the air, each
              taking their turn to talk . We discussed all the technical aspects of the
              hobby endlessly . Our receivers were the subject of lots of remarks . They
              were all homemade and of various different circuit design . Which was
              the best? Which do you use? The receivers were all battery powered in
              order to reduce the hum induced by the 110 volt AC power devices .
                Our ears were flattened against our head from wearing earphones
              for so many hours at a time . At the time, it was legal at the time to play
              phonograph records on the air . Each of us had an old turntable and one
              or two scratchy recordings . I had a Rudy Vallee recording that I used .
              We could recognize a station by its introductory sign-on music .

                Usually in the summer, we would have a big swap meet and all of us
              would gather to have an “eyeball QSO”—Q signals originated on the
              Morse code circuits to reduce the number of words being sent . A QSO
              represented a conversation with another station . QRK meant, “What
              is my signal strength?” That was used extensively as we lived or died
              by the strength of our signal at a distant station . There were many Q
              signals used both on voice and code transmissions .
                Since I had my station up-and-running while in high school, I
              decided to transport it to my physics class for a demonstration . As I
              recall, one of the class assignments was to demonstrate some aspect of
              physics relating to material we had discussed in class .



                                                                           27]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[My transmitter was assembled in a rack made of old bed irons—the
            hardest iron in the world when it came to drilling holes with a dull bit .
            It must have weighed over 200 lbs . It was no easy task, but with the help
            of some friends, we partially disassembled it and my Dad hauled it to
            school in his pickup truck . This was but one of the hurdles we faced .
            Next, what to do about an antenna?  We strung about 200 feet of wire
            between trees in front of the school house . We ran the feed line from
            transmitter to an antenna through an open window . I had Jim stand
            by with his equipment . I fired up the big rig and called, “W9 Zed Eye
            Ex, this is W9 Zed Eye Wy, please come in .” Wow! It really worked . We
            chatted for a few minutes—then, other stations called us, and we were
            able to demonstrate this new means of communication . Needless to say,
            even my physics teacher was impressed . I saw him nearly forty years
            later at a reunion, and he still was impressed!

              As time went on, we improved our original stations . We bought
            more powerful vacuum tubes and replaced homemade gadgets with
            more sophisticated items . We purchased calibrated measuring devices
            so we had some idea of what we were doing . Finally, we managed to
            accumulate enough money to buy a factory-built radio receiver whose
            dials were calibrated and showed us exactly where in the frequency
            spectrum we were operating .
               By and by, I discovered girls, had a car and a job . Jim, in the
            meantime, had built a station that was the envy of anyone seeing it . We
            were now talking with stations all over the world: Australia, England,
            South America, Canada and, of course, the United States . Jim spent
            many nights fighting static and straining to hear those weak signals .
            The war years were just ahead, but we didn’t realize the impact they
            would have on us .

                        How Radio and the War

                              Changed My Life





              My first opportunity to put my newfound radio skills to real-world use
              came while I was still in high school .
                A friend and neighbor of mine, Charles Fields, was serving in the
              Colorado National Guard to supplement his income while he attended
              the University of Colorado . He was a Radio Ham and a Morse code
              operator . As such, he was qualified to operate the Guard’s radio station
              in Longmont .

                I was one of the very few others in the area who had a working
              acquaintance with Morse code, and despite being far too young to join
              the Guard legally, I assisted Charles on a few schedules sending and
              receiving messages . When Charles graduated from the university, he
              resigned his Guard position, leaving the job of Radio Operator open .
              Since I already knew Morse code and was available, they stretched the
              enlistment requirement age to allow me in . I served in this proud unit
              until sometime in 1940 .
                In addition to my duties as radio operator, I trained with my fellow
              guardsmen in the basic military drills . “Private John Doe, Headquarters
              Company, 2  Battalion, 157 Infantry, SIR!” we all sang out when
                        nd
              addressed by a superior at our monthly drill inspections .
                The Guard unit occupied an old auto agency in Longmont, and my
              radio room was located in one of the former offices at one end of the
              front display room . It was about 10 feet square . The radio equipment we
              used was homebrew by Charles Fields . It was quite impressive thanks

                                                                           29]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[to its huge vacuum tube that glowed like a street lamp when lit . At least
            once a week I was required to send and receive messages with other
            units .
              In addition to the monthly drill sessions, we participated in
            two-week training sessions with other Guard units at Camp George
            west of Denver . Every summer, we packed our gear and were hauled
            to camp in huge trucks . My responsibility was to deliver our portable
            radio equipment in good condition . This consisted of two huge boxes
            that could be supported on four fold-up legs; the front opened to
            reveal a radio transmitter and receiver, a hand operated key for sending
            code, a roll of antenna wire to string up from here to there . The most
            impressive unit was a hand-cranked generator, mounted on a platform
            not unlike a bicycle . The operator mounted himself on a seat and firmly
            grasped a crank handle on either side of the generator . By churning
            one’s arms vigorously, the generator could bring about sufficient power
            to run the radios .
              By this time, I had attained the very important rank of Corporal, and
            had a squad of men to do my bidding . I was all of 17 years old, while
            the next youngest member of our squad was probably 25 with a wife
            and child at home . A razor had never, as yet, touched my face . But I had
            something no one else had—a head full of Morse code! At the camp,
            the members of our squad took turns pumping the generator while I sat
            in splendor in front of the panel of dials, knobs, and levers .
              Otherwise, we trained on all other forms of deployment . We dug
            latrines, did KP duty, marched while singing a cadence of songs, and
            trained with rifles . It was still “the age of innocence .” We were happy,
            healthy, and worry-free . Little did we know of the horrors awaiting us
            in a few short years .
              One day my father told me he had learned the Guard was going to
            be called up for extensive maneuvers soon . Once called, there would be
            no resigning! You can hardly just decide to quit an enlistment, but due
            to the intervention of my father who had served with the commanding
            officer of the unit during World War I, I was allowed to get out . It was
            a good move; this unit went to Anzio, Italy . Many were killed, some
            were POWs, and the unit returned badly decimated after the war . Lloyd
            Powell, my future wife’s brother, was one of the survivors .


            30]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[I heard that the Army Air Force could use my talents as a Magneto
              repair man, so I was determined to join that branch of the armed
              forces . I had already spent four years in the Guard as a radio operator
              and reached the exalted rank of Corporal .
                Before I could sign the enlist-
              ment papers for the Army, Pearl
              Harbor was bombed, and the
              Navy issued a call for all holders
              of Amateur Radio Licenses to
              report to the nearest recruiting
              depot . The Navy desperately
              needed people who could copy
              Morse code and were offering a
              nine month course in advanced
              electronics to anyone who would
              enlist in the program . My father
              took me to Denver, and I enlisted
              the same day to go to a top-secret
              school for the newest and most
              secret device, RADAR . I spent   Oliver Edward Lee, age 22, Longmont,

                The things I learned on my own with my cousin Jim were invaluable
              during my entire career, which spanned nearly thirty years of service .
              The years I spent in the Navy were just like having my own huge “Ham”
              shack with everything paid for by Uncle Sam . Were all those years I
              spent teaching myself just a coincidence, or is there really some master
              plan somewhere that gently leads us along?

                                    Margery




            Between high school and the start of war, I met my future wife, Margery
            Roberta Powell . She stole my heart away .
               “Mardie” was a sweet little girl . I don’t think she ever weighed over
            110 lbs ., but she could run the bases and hit a baseball with the best
            of them . Many Sundays were spent on the Powell ranch near Rinn,
            Colorado .
              During our courtship, there were few activities we could afford .
            Everyone played baseball, soccer or touch football . There were enough
            people in her family to field at least part of a team . The Powell family
            consisted of Jessie, Helen, Rolla, Lawrence, Leslie, Margery and Lloyd .
            The three oldest were married, Jessie farmed, Helen and her husband
            had a bakery, and Rolla lived in Longmont .

              We met while Margery was dating a friend of mine . We double-dated
            to the dance pavilion at Lakeside Park in Denver . It cost a dollar to get
            in and a quarter a dance . All the big name bands played there; we heard
            Jimmy Dorsey, Sammy Kay, Benny Goodman, Kay Kaiser and many
            more . She was a much better dancer than I and always had someone
            wanting to cut in . She and her brother Les could jitterbug, and that was
            a sight to behold .
              Longmont had a Jitney Dance every Friday night, sponsored by the
            American Legion . Local talent played all the hit songs for ten cents a
            dance . No one ever missed going . All the farmboys from around Rinn
            had a crush on Margery . Since they grew up together and went to
            school together, I had a lot of competition . Margery’s brother Leslie was
            red-headed and freckled . He was her guardian, and no one had better

              had lots of escorts and chaperones . None of us had any money, so an
              evening at the Jitney and perhaps a Sunday movie was the highlight of
              the week . Movies were 35 cents and a penny for your date . A soda was a
              dime, and we shared it with two straws .
                We knew we wanted to get married, but we were worried about
              the future . Some of our friends a few years older were married and
              were able to rent an apartment and live on a minimum of $17 .50 a
              week .  That was about the rock bottom amount required .  I worked at
              an automotive electrical shop .  I was apprenticed to an old German
              man who, in turn, had been apprenticed to an old German man .  It
              was generally considered to take a minimum of four years to become
              proficient in your trade .  I was paid $5 .00 a week for 60 hours, six days
              a week .  Many days in the summer, we worked 15 or more hours a
              day—with no overtime pay either!  A year later I made $7 .50 a week,
              and when I bought my first car for $35, I received a raise to $12 a week .
              Margery and I began to see the possibility of a future together .  Perhaps
              after another raise a year later, we would be in the $17 .50 a week range .
              We visited young married friends, and we discussed how much every
              item cost .
                Margery had attended a beauty college in Denver .  Her father had
              hocked his gold watch to get enough money for her to go when she
              graduated from high school .  Upon graduation, she worked for Rolla’s
              wife who had a shop in the basement of her home .  She did a shampoo
              and set for twenty five cents, while a permanent cost between $3 .50
              to $5 .00 .  They looked forward to the holidays, when women wanted
              to look especially good .  On a good week, she might make $10, but
              out of that she had to pay for her room and board with brother Rolla .
              Nevertheless, we were optimistic that we could—one day—get married .

                Meanwhile the war clouds were gathering but we paid little or no
              attention to what was going on so far away .
                We had planned to be married in the summer of 1942, and had
              pretty much picked out a small apartment and were thinking of a few
              pieces of furniture . We both had a job, and I owned a slick little 1936
              Chevrolet Coupe with wheel covers on the rear wheels and a little devil
              on the right front fender that lit up when I turned on the lights .


                                                                           33]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[We had been engaged for nearly a year when I was called to active
            duty . Since I had been the radio operator and possessed a valid Ham
            Radio License, I was a prime candidate for some new training program
            that was considered very “hush-hush .” No one had ever heard of
            RADAR in those days, but the project under consideration was one in
            which many men would be trained in the maintenance for this new
            technology . I went from Colorado to a prep school in Los Angeles for
            screening, and a few months later to Treasure Island, California, in the
            San Francisco Bay area .
              Most of us were away from home for the first time and missed our
            family—and most of all, our sweethearts . Shortly after arriving at
            Treasure Island, I decided that if we were ever to be married, it had to
            be now . The school would only be a few months long, and after that, we
            would go to sea—probably for the duration .
              I placed a call to Mardie in Longmont . She was at the local movie;
            the telephone operator called the movie house and they flashed her
            name on the screen saying she had a phone call from a serviceman . I
            asked her if she wanted to come to San Francisco, and she was eager
            to do so—of course! My parents agreed to take her, even though gas
            rationing was already in force .

              Meanwhile, I found an empty apartment at 555 O’Farrell Street—
            almost downtown San Francisco . It had an elevator to the fifth floor and
            there was a big bay window overlooking the lights on the Bay Bridge .
            It had a kitchen, bath, living room with a pull-down bed in the wall, a
            few pieces of furniture, and that was it . I was making $72 a month at
            the time, and needed permission from my commanding officer to get
            married .
              I submitted a special request chit and waited forever for it to come
            back approved .  Without this permission, you were unable to obtain a
            housing allowance for your dependent (all of $30 a month) .  With $102
            a month, we could rent an apartment, feed ourselves, and go out at least
            once a week with sailor friends .
              When the marriage caravan arrived in town, my folks rented a small
            apartment (also on O’Farrell Street, near the one I had), and they kept
            my bride-to-be under wraps until the fateful day .  We were allowed to

              no hanky panky took place!
                I believe Mardie brought rings for us, as I have no recollection of
              buying any .  I had made arrangements with the pastor of a Presbyterian
              (or was it Methodist?) church near O’Farrell Street to be married on
              April 10, 1942 .  We had three days in which to get a license and blood
              tests .
                There was one couple ahead of us and one behind us .  We stood
              up in front of the pastor who had his say and then we had ours .  We
              were pronounced man and wife, and that was that .  That afternoon
              my parents left for Colorado and we were on our own—two kids from
              nowhere in a strange and big city .
                Shortly after, Mardie’s brother Rolla, his wife Dora and their son
              arrived in San Francisco in search of defense-related employment .  He
              immediately found a job in the shipyards building Liberty ships for the
              war effort .  They lived in a hotel near us and later found an apartment
              on Castro Street near Mary’s
              Help Hospital, which would
              later become important in our
              lives .
                It was a thrill to be part of
              such an adventure .  None of
              us had actually been very far
              from home, and everything we
              saw was new and exciting .  We
              laughed and partied and cried
              together .

                War and deployment would
              separate us for long periods .
              That was an issue for so many,
              but we had a special relation-
              ship that would prove out over
              time .

                               Going To War




            Following my graduation from the RADAR school in 1942, I left for a
            new construction vessel in Portland, Oregon, and became the one-and-
            only electronic technician on a Navy mine sweeper . We were deployed
            to the South Pacific and were based near Guadalcanal Island in the
            Solomon Islands . The Japs were firmly entrenched here, and there was
            an abundance of activity of every kind .

              We arrived in the area on Easter Sunday of 1943 and were immedi-
            ately engaged in a skirmish with Japanese fighters who were strafing
            our convoy . My battle station was a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun that shot
            a tracer every few rounds, allowing you to see what you were (or were
            not) hitting . I zeroed in on a Zero, and lo and behold, he ditched a short
            distance away . After the adrenaline subsided, we determined that it was
            not a meatball on the tail of the plane, but a great big star! We picked
            up the pilot, who was pretty upset . No one owned up to who shot him
            down, but I was soon relieved of my gunner’s position .
              I suppose my most exciting experience followed a few months later .
            We were usually tied up at pier in the Florida Islands directly across
            the straits from Guadalcanal . We spent the days here, and the nights on
            anti-submarine patrol . Since we were idle during the days, we became
            acquainted with the crews of the PT boats and other small craft . There
            were always a few vacancies in these crews for daytime cruises to scout
            for downed pilots or any other suspicious activities . My shipmates and I
            would occasionally volunteer to go along as replacements .
              Since I was such a good 20 mm gun operator, I usually sat at one
            as my battle station . We proceeded up the slot toward the island of

              a ferocious dogfight between Japanese and the Marines’ aircraft was
              taking place .
                We were busy shooting and looking for downed pilots when a
              high-flying Jap bomber dropped two bombs on us . We all watched
              them come down . The closer they came, the more they looked like our
              name was printed on them . One bomb hit about twenty feet off the
              starboard side, and another hit twenty feet off the port side .
                The concussion of the explosions split the seams of the vessel we
              were on, and it immediately began to sink . The men in the engine room
              were unable to abandon ship, and the rest of us were barely able to
              get in the water before it sank . To add insult to injury, several fighters
              decided to strafe the survivors . It is difficult to swim very far underwa-
              ter, especially oil-covered water . I had taken off my life preserver when
              I went into the water, so I was able to submerge myself better than some
              of my shipmates who were all pretty well-shot-up and could not put
              their life vests on .
                Fortunately, we were no more than a few miles from a small,
              tree-covered island . Under the cover of our fighters, the survivors
              managed to swim this distance and get up on the beach . While lying
              there, catching our breath, we could see a good deal of activity taking
              place a mile or so up the beach . The Marine fighters were strafing the
              beach and shooting up the trees . When we got to our feet, we could
              see a good number of Japanese soldiers running down the sand in
              our direction . We immediately retreated in the opposite direction,
              barefooted on the sharp coral, over fallen trees and through shrubs
              growing along the water line . Never again was I able to run so fast . We
              hid ourselves in the undergrowth, and the friendly aircraft continued
              to cover us by shooting at anything that looked unfriendly . Darkness
              came, and we spent a very long night huddled together . At first light, we
              could hear aircraft overhead again, and it was not long before a rescue
              ship made its way toward the beach and took us off in rubber rafts . We
              were pretty shaken and scratched-up, hungry, and a bit frightened .

                This was one of many minor incidents that occurred during a war,
              and hardly any notice was ever given or received . I will not burden you
              with further adventures! I did receive an advancement to Chief Petty

                                   Back Home




              Sometime in 1944, I received a letter saying I had been appointed
              Warrant Officer and was to report to a communications unit in San
              Diego . I was assigned as an electronics officer to a small carrier, “The
              Hollandia Bay .” Eventually it made its way to Los Angeles, where we all
              went our own way . I spent almost a month on leave in Longmont with
              my wife, daughter, parents, and brother .

                The unit was recalled to San Francisco and followed the Marines
              onto Guam . My job was to help install high-powered radio transmitters
              at the Naval Radio Communication Station near Agana, Guam . There
              was still considerable Japanese activity on the island, and since our
              antenna fields were far from the beach activities, we were constantly
              harassed by Japanese snipers . I remained here until the war was over in
              1945 . I returned to Longmont and was discharged from active duty, but
              I remained in the reserves as a warrant officer .
                Civilian life held no thrill for me after years of war . I tried working;
              I built a new house and had two more children, but I was still very
              unhappy . I finally returned to the Navy, and since I had remained in the
              Reserves, I was able to re-enlist at my permanent rank of Chief Petty
              Officer .
                In 1949, I went to Totsuka, Japan, accompanied by my family . I was
              assigned to a Japanese radio transmitter station that was concealed
              underground . The antenna wires were strung through a forest of tall
              pine trees . My job, along with a crew of USN personnel, was to move
              the Japanese equipment from the caves to the buildings above-ground
              and construct a new antenna field .


                                                                           39]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[Wherever I was sent in the Navy, I managed to have a Ham station .
            During this time, I had access to some surplus radio equipment, which
            I immediately set up on the amateur radio bands . Fortunately, the
            Station Master was fluent in English . He had also been a “Ham” in
            prewar-Japan . The amateur radio service had only been restored a short
            time . One of the first tasks I asked of the Station Master was to build me
            a directional antenna pointed at San Francisco .

              Shortly thereafter, I was once again calling, “W9 Zed Eye Ex, this is
            JA2CQ”—my assigned station call while I was in Japan . Jim and I had a
            weekly schedule . My parents were able to visit Jim at his home, and my
            children and wife were able to chat with them every week . Sometimes,
            I would have guests that wanted to talk to their loved ones in the States .
            Gradually, more and more people turned up to use my station . At this
            time, telephone service to the States was very limited . It was provided
            by underwater cable, which was generally carrying high-priority
            circuits .
              We reconstructed the former Japanese naval transmitter station
            above-ground and operated the Japanese equipment for many years .
            The technicians at the station were all former Japanese Navy sailors
            who had been aboard ships that had been sunk by one means or
            another .  It was a real experience discussing various battles we had each
            participated in . I must say, I have never experienced a more dedicated
            crew, and never at any time felt threatened by any of them . My wife and
            family, plus twenty USN personnel, administered and supervised this
            station during my tour there . My children spoke Japanese as well as
            English . Reluctantly, I left this tour of duty in 1952 .
              I was then assigned to the USN Radio Transmitter Facility in
            Annapolis, Maryland where I was the Chief Radio Technician . During
            this time, I received a letter informing me I had been re-appointed to
            the rank of Warrant Officer W-2 . We remained at this base for nearly
            three years .
              In 1955, I was transferred from my Annapolis duty station to the
            Naval Air Development Center in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and was
            desperate for housing . I had just left a real-estate office, looking pretty
            dejected, when an old gentleman walked up and asked if I was looking
            for a place to live . He had two sons who were Marine pilots, and had


            40]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[built each of them a lovely bungalow on his estate, Look Away Farm .
              Without ever looking at the house, I had my household effects shipped
              to the address he gave me .
                What a wonderful home: two stories (plus a basement), a fireplace,
              library, and sitting room . Everything you might have seen in a travel
              brochure . I was living on practically nothing, so he rented the house to
              me for $100 a month . I shot pheasants that were hustling up a meal in
              the cornfield from the upstairs bedroom window, stole tomatoes from
              a nearby farm, and ate fish sticks that were rejects because they were
              broken .

                The Admiral had a farmhouse dating back into the 1600s, beautifully
              maintained with a marvelous library and chart room that he also made
              available to us . He had a pet circus pony, so he took each of my three
              kids for rides .

                We lived there for two years . In spite of the hardships, it is one of my
              family’s most cherished memories .

                At the end of this tour in Pennsylvania, we went to Santa Ana,
              California, where I went aboard the USS Logan, an attack transport
              ship (APA), as the electronics officer .

                Following this tour of duty, we were assigned to the U .S . Naval
              Communications Station in Adak, Alaska . I was advanced to the rank
              of W-3 and was the officer in charge of the station for two years . My
              family accompanied me here, and we spent most of the time exploring
              the abandoned fortifications left by the Army during the war .
                About 1957, we received orders to the Radioman Class A School in
              San Diego, where I was the instructor and supervisor for nearly 100
              chief petty officers and several hundred students . Although this was a
              pleasant tour of duty and the living conditions were wonderful, it was
              not my favorite job .
                About 1959, we received orders to the USS Henrico APA 45, which
              was home-ported in San Diego . I spent about three years aboard as the
              electronics officer . I had lots of time on my hands, so I requested to be
              qualified as an underway officer of the deck . I did not have a great deal
              of experience in this field . My CO thought it was an unusual request
              but agreed to give it a try . During this period, I managed to bring the

              In 1962, I received orders to the U .S . Naval Communication Station
            in San Miguel, Philippines . My family accompanied me, but without my
            oldest daughter Linda, who remained behind to begin her life on her
            own . We had a lovely home on the beach in San Miguel, and my son
            Jim was able to surf to his heart’s content . After a year or more in San
            Miguel, I was sent to a new construction site in Tarlac, Philippines, to
            assist in the construction of a new radio transmitter station . We put this
            station in commission, and I served as the electronics officer there for
            about another year .

              We received orders to Point Sur, California, in 1964 . I was assigned
            to a naval facility at the base of the mountain that held the Point
            Sur Lighthouse . It was an imposing sight from down the highway .
            Unfortunately, the weather at Point Sur was miserable, so it wasn’t the
            most pleasant place to live . I advanced to pay grade W-4 there . While
            at Point Sur, my son Jim attended Monterey Peninsula College and my
            youngest daughter Terry graduated from high school . Unfortunately, I
            lost my dear wife Mardie in 1966 .
              I decided to retire from the Navy after nearly 26 years of service
            because I still had two children who needed me . Shortly after my retire-
            ment, Jim joined the Navy, and a few months later Terry followed him .
              Subsequently, I met and married Rowena Kelly, who lived in Big Sur
            and taught school there . We moved to Longmont for a short time, then
            on to Alexandria, Virginia, where I was employed by an electronics
            firm that built communications equipment for the military . The civilian
            world was not to my liking—especially living in the Washington,
            D .C . area—so we moved back to Colorado . We purchased a home in
            Hygiene, near where I was born, and we lived there for another 30-plus
            years .
              While in Hygiene, I attended the University of Colorado, Boulder,
            to obtain my electrical engineering degree . During my tenure in the
            Navy, I had occasion to have young college graduates working for me
            and wondered what they knew that I didn’t . Turned out it wasn’t all that
            much!

                            Villa Maud Billings



                  Villa Maud Billings (22 Feb 1898–10 May 1987)



              My mother Villa was born in 1898 in Lyons, Colorado . She was the
              second daughter in the family of Norman Arthur Billings and Bessie
              McCall . Her family were pioneers in the area, arriving in 1860 to
              homestead a ranch near Lyons and Hygiene .
                Some of the stories my mother has told me about her family life
              when she was young make one realize they were pretty hardy people .
              Adversity was no stranger to them . Growing up in Lyons, her family
              often hit hard times . One winter, they spent the entire time living in a
              tent near Lyons . One Christmas, Mother told me that Granddad went
              to town and traded his pocket watch for bananas . That Christmas
              morning, each child had a banana in their Christmas stocking .
                When her father Norman started his sawmill in Estes Park, Villa
              and her two sisters cooked and cleaned for the sawmill hands . As she
              became a teenager, she worked as a hotel maid in the new Stanley Hotel
              that had opened for vacationers . It was the first real job for money she
              had . We have pictures of her in her maid’s uniform .
                In 1919, Villa met her future husband, Clarence Edward Lee . He
              was a college graduate, had a car, and wore nice clothes . He looked
              pretty good to her! They were married on August 31, 1919 in Boulder,
              Colorado, six months after they met . Clarence always provided a home
              and plenty of food for the family, even though there was not a lot of
              money for frivolous things .




                                                                           51]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[Villa was a housewife and homemaker, as was the tradition in those
            days . Cleanliness was next to Godliness at all times . Floors and clothes
            were constantly cleaned to present a good image . She canned vegetables
            and fruit each year, which were stored in the cellar . No credit was ever
            sought; everything purchased was paid for in cash . She thought that
            her two boys, Oliver and Byron, were far superior to any in the town of
            Longmont . She made sure they didn’t get in trouble or associate with
            boys who were not of the best reputation .

              I remember my mother playing the piano, but only when I was
            young . She used to play old World War I music and sing along with it . I
            think she used to play because it made her life more bearable . We were
            in the midst of the Depression years, and there was much of life that
            was very difficult . Men would come to our door, asking to chop wood
            or do chores for a meal . There must have been some kind of under-
            ground alert system to tell people where they could get a handout, as I
            could see them walking up the street and stopping at no other place but
            ours . They would sit on the back steps, and my mother would prepare
            a meal of some kind for them . Men would come to our door in the
            evenings and ask my father for just a few days’ work . He would always
            tell them to come to his office in the morning and he would give them
            a couple of days work for, I expect, only a dollar or so a day . Living in
            those times would probably depress the best of us .
              Villa was happiest when she was with her mother and sisters, telling
            stories and laughing . Visiting her parents in Estes Park was a high
            priority, and nearly weekly, trips were made up the mountain road
            to their home . She always had Christmas dinner at our house for the
            Billings family, while Thanksgiving was in Estes Park with her parents .

                          Clarence Edward Lee



                  Clarence Edward Lee (5 Apr 1894–12 Jan 1965)



              My father Clarence was born in 1894 in Nelson, Nebraska . He was the
              youngest son of Jesse Alvin Lee and Minnie Collins .

                The Lee family moved to Colorado in 1895 and settled in the
              Hygiene area . I heard my father say that he wasn’t raised, he just grew
              up . Apparently, his parents were very relaxed since he was the fourth
              and youngest child .

                His father was a farmer during those days, so he grew up on a farm .
              After high school in Hygiene, he attended Colorado State College in
              Fort Collins to study civil engineering . It is not too clear how long he
              attended, but he received a degree in civil engineering and maintained
              an interest in that field for the rest of his life . We have many pictures of
              his college days, and he seemed to enjoy life thoroughly .
                In 1917, at the age of 22 years, he enlisted in the Army as a private in
              the 41  Balloon Company Air Service . He was sent to South Carolina
                   st
              for training, contracted and survived the flu during the epidemic, and
              seemed to have a good old time going to balls and visiting the local
              young ladies .
                I had some insight into his activities at training camp from a diary I
              found in a trunk that contained his uniform and various memorabilia .
              Being young and naïve, I failed to understand the significance of several
              entries, “We visited Mabel again tonight!” Soon, the diary no longer
              rested in the trunk . He was discharged from service in December, 1918 .



                                                                           53]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[It was about this time that he met a young lady in Estes Park .
            Pictures show him escorting her in his father’s car and going on picnics .
            At the end of the war, our father and mother were married, and with
            the assistance of Grandfather Lee, bought a small house in Hygiene
            where I was born a scant nine months later .
              Clarence’s father Jesse gave him the blacksmith business . The black-
            smith business probably wasn’t very good by that time, and Clarence
            was soon working on roads for the county . He was the Road Supervisor
            for District 2 of Boulder County for 12 years .
              They moved to Longmont in 1927, just before their second son,
            Byron, was born . In 1933, Clarence became the street superintendent
            for the City of Longmont, a job that he held for about 15 years . His
            “claim to fame” was paving all the streets of Longmont in the late 1930s
            and early 1940s, as well as many of the streets in neighboring towns at
            about the same time .
              In about 1942 or 1943, Clarence took a leave of absence to work
            on World War II airports as chief inspector of airport construction
            in Nebraska . He and his family—I was away in the Navy—lived in
            Alliance and Scottsbluff for about six months .
              Clarence was slight in build, seemed to get along with people, and
            was addicted to cigarettes and pipes . He was a life-long Republican,
            probably because his father was a New Deal Democrat . They loved to sit
            on the screen porch on Sunday nights and talk about politics for hours .
              Clarence was a devoted son who frequently visited his father and
            mother and took care of them in their old age . He probably received
            considerable help from his father in his early years in the form of loans
            for purchase of homes . Late in the 1940s, Clarence started buying and
            selling homes in Longmont . The family would live in the home for a
            few years, and then they would sell it .

              In 1948, Clarence moved to Boulder to take a job with the City of
            Boulder as streets superintendent . He worked there for three years
            when he became ill and had to leave the job . Clarence and Villa then
            moved back to Longmont, where he finished his career in the area
            with the State License Bureau through 1952 and then as Longmont
            water superintendent until 1957 . From there he went to Chula Vista,
            California, as the Assistant Director of Public Works for four years .

            54]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[However, when it came time to retire, they moved back to Longmont
              where both Clarence and Villa lived the rest of their lives .
                One of the Clarence’s hobbies was to travel to various parts of the
              western United States during his summer vacation . Somehow, every
              trip included a visit to some huge bridge or dam project; I believe we
              saw all of them .
                He was proud of his sons and their achievements, but did not believe
              that a college education was necessary, or that he could afford it . That
              left it up to me and Byron to cope . Both of us went into the Navy .
              Byron was able to attend the Naval Academy . I was able to attend the
              University of Colorado on the GI bill after I left the Navy . Both of us
              graduated with engineering degrees .

            Jesse Alvin Lee and Minnie Collins



                Jesse Alvin Francis Lee (23 Dec 1859–4 Feb 1949)
               Elvira ‘Minnie’ Collins (25 May 1866–22 Jan 1960)



            Jesse was born in December, 1859, in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and Minnie was
            born in May, 1866, in Loami, Illinois . They were married in Nelson,
            Nebraska, on November 9, 1882 . Both lived in good health until they
            were almost 90 years old .
              Minnie’s ancestors were mostly merchants and farmers . The Collins
            came from Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Iowa .  Jesse’s ancestors were also
            merchants, newspaper men and farmers . The Lees came to Colorado
            via New York, Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska .
              It was my understanding that Minnie and Jesse met while she was
            the “hired girl” assisting his mother in Nebraska . Jesse and Minnie
            settled in Hygiene, Colorado, just before the turn of the century, and
            lived their lives out in several different homes near Hygiene, Lyons, and
            Longmont .
              Jesse first homesteaded a few miles north of Hygiene . Records show
            that he borrowed $300 to buy seed for his first wheat crop from a local
            farmer who had considerable interests in the gold mining fields of
            Central City, Colorado . His first crop was apparently successful and he
            built his first home on a sixty-acre farm . The house is still standing and
            has been extensively remodeled since; it is about a hundred years old
            now .

              Jesse and Minnie had four children, all born in Nebraska, and were
            quite young when they moved to Colorado . Our father, Clarence, was


            56]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[the youngest . The other children Clyde, Jennie and Amy were a few
              years older—Jennie being the eldest .
                Grandmother Lee probably did not have an education extending
              beyond about the sixth grade, but that was not unusual in those days,
              when children were needed to work the farm and assist their mother in
              raising the younger members of the family .
                Minnie was determined that her children would be educated and
              not be subjected to the drudgery she had known . By saving her butter
              and egg money, plus income from milk and cream, and selling garden
              produce, she managed to send Clarence (and possibly Amy) to college
              in Fort Collins, where the Colorado Agriculture College was then
              located . Each received two years of higher education . The girls learned
              to play the piano and the finer points of etiquette in anticipation of
              being the wife of a successful businessman . Our father was a civil
              engineer .
                By the time I came along, Jesse and Minnie had a good number
              of grandchildren, but no grandsons yet bore the family surname . My
              grandfather Lee wanted me to be named in his behalf—at least the first
              name, Jesse . My mother, being of stubborn Scottish ancestry, resisted
              this, and to this day I’m carrying her preference . I was told I was named
              after Oliver Wendell Holmes, a distinguished scholar and man of letters .
              I blame this on my grandmother Billings’ penchant for naming her
              children after prominent people who were in the news at the time her
              children were born .  As an example, Uncle Norton Billings always said
              his name was Norton Roy Roosevelt Peabody Billings . This included
              the current president, the secretary of war, and the vice president . I
              often felt our mother was named after Pancho Villa who was at that
              time a Mexican rebel general seeking to free Mexico from the Spanish .
              Probably not true, as I see somewhere in the list of ancestors there is a
              Maud, but no Villa . But I digress, so on with the story . . . .
                By this time Jesse, known as “Al,” had given up farming and was the
              village blacksmith in Hygiene . For many years, I had an assortment of
              his blacksmithing tools . They were either made by our grandfather or
              our father for special applications when they were blacksmithing . They
              had a home quite close to our parents in Hygiene .




                                                                           57]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[Since the two households were within walking distance, Minnie
            spent a considerable amount of time overseeing my activities—much to
            the consternation of my own mother, I’m sure . She frequently invited
            me to spend time with her in their home, which was a large two story
            typical of farmhouses . It had a large, lived-in kitchen with a big black
            and chrome kitchen range that always seemed ready to disgorge fresh
            bread, cookies, a pie, or a cake almost every day . My earliest recollec-
            tion of Grandmother Lee was being smothered in her ample bosom
            as she hugged me . This continued until I was tall enough to avoid the
            smotherings—but not the hugs .
              While Minnie was a young woman in Hygiene she served as midwife
            to many of her neighbors, bringing a good number of children into
            this world . She was pretty independent and exercised these duties
            frequently . On one occasion, she decided the parlor needed a few more
            square feet of floor space . While Granddad was gone one day, she took
            a hammer, saw and wrecking bar and removed one entire wall . This
            wall was, unfortunately, a load-bearing wall, and the upstairs suddenly
            sagged several inches and continued to creak and moan . Never mind,
            she had her extra room! When Granddad returned in the evening, he
            asked our father to help him install a few new supports to hold up the
            second floor . These new supports eventually held a span of bookshelves
            between them, so everyone gained a little .
              When our father returned from the war and was married, Granddad
            Lee gave him the blacksmith business . Granddad Lee then assumed
            the duties of Water Commissioner for the local water district . This job
            consisted of regulating the flow of water from the river into the various
            irrigation ditches in the area . To clarify this activity: first came the river
            flowing out of the mountains, some of which was used, but it mostly
            just flowed on out across the plains and eventually into the Gulf of
            Mexico . Then came the farmers: they formed a cooperative and dug
            ditches from the river to their fields . There were many farms and miles
            of ditch to supply them . Later arrivals then built their own ditches to
            irrigate their fields . The water law states that the first ditch dug has prior
            water rights over those later dug . The job of the Water Commissioner
            was to see that each had his fair share of water, and when the water
            levels were low, those with first rights got water before those with newer
            rights . When a farmer required water for his crops, he contacted the

            58]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[Water Commissioner and requested a number of acre-feet of water to
              begin at a certain time . Granddad Lee then opened the head-gate at the
              river and allowed water to flow in the ditch until the amount of water
              specified was delivered . Incidentally, an acre-foot of water is the exact
              amount of water required to cover an acre of ground with one foot of
              water .
                Being Water Commissioner required a considerable amount of
              traveling, so Granddad had to have a car—the first one in his life .
              Previously, a buggy and horse had been adequate for whatever travels
              they needed to make . I don’t remember the transition from horse to
              horseless carriage, but I expect it was a traumatic experience to go from
              shoeing horses to repairing flat tires .
                During the summer of about 1925, I recall a salesman trying to sell
              him a new car .  At that time, the automobile dealer would let you use
              the new car for several days to see if your enthusiasm over having a new
              car overcame your reluctance to part with the money .  When we speak
              of the cost of automobiles back then, we are generally talking about
              $300 to $400 and any color you desired—as long as it was black . This
              particular car was a STAR roadster . It had a soft top, open sides and a
              rumble seat . Granddad said he would buy the car if it would go up the
              hill west of town in high gear . Since I was standing around with nothing
              better to do, he invited me to go on the test run . We roared out of
              Hygiene and up the road at top speed . The hill, which looked so for-
              midable, slowed us to a crawl, but the wind was still fresh in our faces .
              Granddad had a big smile on his face as he coaxed every bit of speed he
              could out of it . The little roadster topped the hill, still in high gear, and
              jumped up in the air clicking its rear wheels together in sheer delight .
              He drove that little STAR roadster many years before replacing it with
              an automobile that had actual roll-up windows and doors to keep the
              snow and cold out .

                Granddad was small of stature, probably no more than 5’6” . I would
              estimate his weight at around 150 lbs . He wore a mustache all the years
              I knew him, even in pictures of him as a young man . He had very blue
              eyes and light brown hair . He always wore a white shirt, tie and a vest,
              giving him the appearance of having employment that did not muss his
              clothes or dirty his hands .  The little finger on his left hand had been
              severed at the second joint . When he had something on his mind, he
                                                                           59]]></page><page Index="70"><![CDATA[would pace the floor back and forth, wiggling this little stub of a finger .
            He told me a pig had bitten it off while he was feeding the herd . He
            always smoked a pipe, and in later years, he was banned from the house
            proper to sit next to the furnace in the basement in an old rocking
            chair . Some of our best times together were in the old dark basement,
            next to the big black furnace .
              He seemed to have two joys in life: one was reading, and the other
            was playing cards at the local Odd Fellows Hall . I must have inherited
            my love of reading from him . He always had a stack of newspapers,
            magazines and books near his favorite chair .

              One of his favorite diversions was westerns (usually in the form
            of pulp paper publications) . The covers were always extravagantly
            illustrated, with cowboys mounted on rearing horses and guns ablaze . I
            learned to read consuming these magazines .

              One of our favorite heroes was a fellow
            named Silver Tip who rode a horse that could
            travel forty miles without faltering, carry him
            out of harm’s way, and warn him of impending
            danger . Silver Tip was a weekly serial, and
            I could hardly wait until he had read the
            magazine and put it on the pile that I could
            take home with me . We often speculated on
            what adventure Silver Tip would be engaged in
            next . He would allow me to borrow one book   Max Brand’s Silver Tip and the
            at a time from his library, and always expected   Fighting Four
            me to be able to discuss it with him when I
            returned it .
              Grandmother Lee was a typical grandmother . She usually wore an
            apron, and her hair was short and very white . She was probably about
            5’6” tall . She had an ample bosom and enjoyed a good meal . Her
            abiding joy was her children, and she especially wanted them around
            her if possible . Jenny lived on a farm a short distance away and had two
            sons; Amy lived not far in the other direction, and had two daughters
            and four sons . Clyde Lee migrated to Idaho and we seldom saw him . He
            had six daughters .

              going to and returning from school . The going was uneventful, but
              every afternoon as I would start home, I was greeted by Grandma Lee .
              She wanted to hear about what we had done that day, and she always
              had some kind of goodies she wanted to share with me . I suppose my
              mother wondered why I never had much of an appetite for supper at
              night .

                In the late 1920s, Granddad retired since his sight was not too great .
              He was always knocking the corners off his car on unseen poles and
              trees . During these days, there was no such thing as a social security
              program to care for the elderly . When you were no longer able to work,
              you lived with one of your children . Fortunately, he had always been
              able to put a little aside, so he was financially independent when the
              time came . He began to loan out a few dollars here-and-there to folks
              who were down on their luck . An occasional house was also financed
              by him . Modest homes at this time could be purchased for under
              $1,000 . He kept a ledger showing how much was loaned to whom, and
              every week there would be an entry showing as little as twenty-five
              cents being repaid . Interest rates were about six percent—not all that
              different from those charged today . I found his ledger in Mother’s home
              when we cleaned it out after she died . It was quite fascinating, and I
              could understand how he was able to assist family members in their
              time of need . Incidentally, some repaid him and some did not—but
              strangers always did .
                Obviously, as I grew older, I saw less and less of my grandparents, but
              I know they were always interested in what I was doing . I always took
              whatever young lady I happened to be interested in by to meet them .
              Some got the thumbs-up and some got the thumbs-down . Many years
              later, I could appreciate their judgment . How they figured it out on such
              short notice, I don’t know!

                Granddad passed away on a cold January day in 1948 . He had been
              ill only a short time, and had led a good life . I was the only one to shed
              a tear at his funeral . We had a special relationship not enjoyed by my
              cousins, so I especially felt the loss . In spite of not being named Jesse in
              honor of him, I inherited his gold Hamilton pocket watch and have it
              still . It is a thing of beauty and always reminds me of our close friend-

              Grandmother lived another ten years, spending the last of her time
            in a nursing home . She had always read the Bible every day of her
            life, and was comforted by it to the end . Whenever I came home on
            leave from the Navy, she insisted on seeing the children, but was not
            acquainted with them well enough to single them out . She enjoyed
            reminiscing and could tell you every detail of a given picnic or party,
            but had forgotten some of the more recent events .
              Both are buried in Hygiene Cemetery . I visit their gravesites every
            Memorial Day and plant some flowers to commemorate them . I can
            see their headstone from the highway, and always says a silent hello
            when passing . They gave me an anchor and the strength to say “no” to
            activities I knew they would disapprove of . I loved them very much and
            miss them .
              I consider it a privilege to have known them and to have had their
            love .

                          As I look back on my sinful life
                          I often wonder why I’m here .
                          In this mad world of sin and strife
                          The reason to me is not so clear .

                          Oh, I have never been in jail
                          Nor have I anyone defrauded,
                          But I have pot shot coveys of quail
                          And some melon patches I have marauded .

                          I never yet have killed a man,
                          But I have harbored thoughts of murder .
                          And thought to myself that if I ever can,
                          I’d sure get even with that old Duffer .

                          I wish that I were young again,
                          I’d try to be a better sport .
                          I’d quit pounding iron and rushing the can
                          And make a living selling short .

                          I wish that I was old enough
                          To get a pension from the State,
                          For then I wouldn’t have to work,
                          But could set around and agitate .

                          I very seldom go to church,
                          And that is why I am so bad,
                          But I play cards at the Odd Fellows Hall
                          Where some of the members call me Dad .

                          If I could beat them, I’d give a dollar
                          To anyone who would thank me for it,
                          But the trouble is that when I deal
                          My lead I nearly always forfeit .

                          So I don’t know just what to do
                          To save my face and be a winner,
                          Unless I get someone else to deal,
                          And then I think I could beat the sinner .

                        Norman Arthur Billings

                             and Bessie McCall



                 Norman Arthur Billings (5 Nov 1874–3 Feb 1964)
                      Bessie McCall (12 Mar 1877–8 May 1964)



              There was a real contrast between our two sets of grandparents . While
              the Lee family was serious and carried on long discussions of the
              topics of the day, the Billings family was full of jokes and laughter and
              horseplay .
                My grandfather Norman was just six years old when he rode in the
              covered wagon from South Dakota to Lyons, Colorado with his father
              and stepmother . Bessie was raised near McCall Lake, which is just west
              of Hygiene, Colorado . In fact, until just a few years ago, the sod house
              they lived in was still standing .
                Grandmother and Granddad Billings were married on the Fourth of
              July, 1894 . Children arrived on a predictable schedule: about every two
              years .
                The family lived off the land for many years, and Norman knew how
              to do it . He seldom had much money and he had a growing family .
              They ate trout and venison, they sometimes lived in a tent, and on one
              occasion they had to farm out a child to keep going . He worked for his
              father in the sawmill business, ran his own sawmill business at Fishing
              Creek, near Estes Park . He drove stagecoaches, worked as a toll gate
              keeper, and was the Town Marshall in Estes Park . We learned the hard
              way that he kept a loaded gun in his dresser; I fired it through the floor
              one Sunday while we were visiting .
                                                                           65]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[Granddad had a team of horses or mules and a wagon . He made his
            living hauling freight to the stone quarries and back into the mountains
            for miners and ranchers . At this time, the family lived in Lyons, where
            his children were born (with the exception of Ted who was born in
            Estes Park, and Norma who was born in Longmont) .
              One of the various jobs Granddad had was tending a toll road
            barrier . He and his family lived in a small house next to a privately built
            and owned road above Lyons . When wagons or horsemen wanted to go
            into the mountains, they had to pay a toll to the gatekeeper to continue
            on their way . Recently, I accompanied a local historian to the site of this
            barrier and found the remains of the house, as well as part of the stones
            used to hold the log gate across the road .
              About that time, Norm drove a stagecoach from the Lyons train
            depot to Estes Park carrying eastern passengers to vacation in Rocky
            Mountain National Park . I have a photo of him in his big Stetson hat,
            sitting high on a stagecoach . He cut quite a figure with a team of horses
            and a long whip in hand . The ladies in their long skirts and big hats
            were enough to frighten the horses . I don’t know how long it took to
            make the drive . The distance was about 20 miles, so I expect that it was
            a full day’s drive . One of Norm’s passions was to stand high on the side
            of a mountain and see how loud he could holler . It was said that you
            could hear him for miles .
              He was a quiet man in a family setting, just enjoying all the fun the
            family was having telling wild stories and laughing . He didn’t drink
            alcohol or smoke except on very special occasions . He was always very
            fit and able to do manual work around his home, even late in his life .
              Most of my memories of Grandmother Billings, when I was young,
            were of her surrounded by her sons and daughters—everyone talking
            and laughing, big dinners with good food contributed by everyone, and
            never a serious word spoken .
              During the years our parents lived in Hygiene, Grandma and
            Grandpa Billings were living in Longmont . In 1912, Norman and
            Bessie moved to Estes Park and homesteaded on Fish Creek just south
            of town, where they spent the rest of their lives . There was a railroad
            spur line that ran from Longmont to Lyons . The train ran twice a day
            between the two towns . We had a train depot just a short distance from

            66]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[our house—in fact, the track ran directly in front of our home . My
              mother would take me on the train to town on the morning run, and
              we would return on the evening run . I was told it cost ten cents for her,
              and my ride was free .
                The original purpose of the train was to haul Lyons red sandstone—
              a most spectacular stone—to the building trades . It is still mined and
              transported, but has become so expensive that is a rare thing to see an
              entire building constructed using it . The stone came from the quarries
              owned by Uncle Jim and Eddy McCall (Bessie’s brothers) .
                My very first recollection of Grandma was of her chasing me around
              and around the raspberry patch when we lived in Hygiene . She was
              always a pretty hefty grandma, so she really huffed and puffed from the
              effort . I don’t expect she was really trying to catch me, but I was fooled
              at the time . She always wore her hair in a bun piled on the top of her
              head . It was very black, and as I recall, it never really turned white . She
              had dark eyes and a couple of moles on her face . She had a nice smile
              and a happy face .
                Grandmother Billings was an expert at reading tea leaves .
              Sometimes, I really believed she could actually read them . One of my
              favorite things was to take my girlfriend to Estes Park and let Bessie
              check her out with the tea leaves . After serving us tea, there was always
              a gathering of leaves in the bottom of the cup; Bessie would turn
              the cup over and place it in the saucer, slowly turning it first in one
              direction, then the other . She would pass one hand over the cup and
              cover her eyes with the other . After the proper amount of suspense, she
              would turn the cup over and study it for some time before beginning .
              She would amaze us with her predictions of the future and accuracy of
              her knowledge of the past . Of course, like all fortune tellers, she had a
              good knowledge of young people and the things they had likely done .
              She was a great storyteller and a favorite of my lady friends .
                She was great with stories . Our favorite trick was to have others
              around who really didn’t know us well, then start a wild tale . We would
              embellish the other’s statements with even wilder ones of our own .
              Usually, these stories were about the mountains, bad storms and wild
              animals: cougars, snakes or bears . Someone would always need to go
              to the doctor or call for help of another kind . They would strap on skis


                                                                           67]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[and become lost while they were stalked by some ferocious animal .
            Sometimes we actually scared the heck out of ourselves .
              She finally had to wear a hearing aid, which consisted of the earpiece
            and a rather large box containing batteries and electronics . One of my
            favorite pranks was to engage her in conversation, then gradually lower
            my voice until only my lips were moving with no sound . She would
            continue to listen as though she was hearing every word, frantically
            turning up the volume control . Needless to say, a return to normal
            speaking voice always blew her ears off . We went through this routine
            many times, and we both knew that the other knew what was going on .
            It always ended with her trying to bash me, much to the amusement of
            the uninitiated in the room .
              My grandmother and I exchanged letters for many years starting
            when I was quite young . She always answered promptly, encouraging
            me in whatever my current interest was . She was always game for any
            kind of joke .
              Norm and Bessie lived in Estes for more than 50 years . He and Bessie
            both died in 1964 after lots of hard work, but never lacked in humor
            and a bag full of tricks .

                 Thomas McCall and Eliza Jones



                      Thomas McCall (2 May 1830–1 Aug 1885)
                     Eliza ‘Uita’ Jones (25 Dec 1843–1 Dec 1912)



              I found a letter written to Grandmother Bessie Billings from her aunt,
              whose name is missing from the letter . In it, she included a record of
              the McCall family, which I shall paraphrase here .
                Thomas McCall, Bessie’s father, was born on May 2, 1830, in Carroll
              County, Ohio . He moved to Hamilton County, Iowa, in 1851 . In 1860,
              he settled in the St . Vrain Valley, south of McCall Lake . He proved up
              on his homestead, then returned to Iowa where he married Eliza Jones
              in January 1866 at Webster City, Iowa . Thomas died on August 1, 1885 .
              His headstone is in evidence in the old Hygiene Cemetery . Eliza was
              born December 25, 1843, and died December 1, 1912, at age 68 years,
              11 months . Thomas had the first team of horses in the St . Vrain Valley .
              He drove them from Iowa after he and Eliza were married .
                These are their children:
                1. Clara McCall (1866–1951) married John Walker on March 10,
                  1887 . I do remember her and her husband . They lived in Estes
                  Park for many years and seemed well-to-do folks .

                2. Wilbert McCall (1866–1917) married, but I have no information .
                3. Thomas McCall (1869–1923) lived in Lyons all his life .
                4. May McCall (1871–1923) married Lee Battles in 1889 and died in
                  Lindsey, California .
                5. Eleanor McCall (1873–1904) married in 1891 to Elmer Freeman .
                6. Theodore ‘Jim’ McCall (1875–1932)

                                                                          69]]></page><page Index="80"><![CDATA[7. Bessie McCall, our grandmother (1877–1964) married July 4,
                 1893, to Norm Billings .
              8. Robert McCall (1881–1881) lived two months .
              9. Edward McCall (1883–1956)
              The McCalls were real rascals . There were many hair-raising
            incidents recited years ago, but with no one to share them with, I’ve
            pretty much forgotten most of them . The Billings side of the family was
            more genteel, but not anyone you wanted to cross .
              The McCall dairy farm was a short distance from McCall Lake . It
            belonged to Uncle Percy Goss, who married into the Lee family (his
            wife was my father’s sister) .
              I do recall seeing both Uncle Eddie and Jim several times . The
            McCall men were tall and wore big mustaches, but were otherwise
            clean-shaven . They had penetrating dark eyes and straight hair . Since
            I only knew Uncle Eddie and Uncle Jim, I can hardly judge the others;
            pictures I have seen showed them to be cut the same . They mostly
            scared the heck out of me!
              The McCall women tended to be on the chunky side, but then I only
            knew them when they were older . They seemed to possess a good deal
            more humor and were not quite as serious as their brothers . In these
            times, living and providing for a family was serious business; there were
            no handouts from Washington .

              Eddie and Jim McCall lived in a small house in Lyons County,
            Colorado . They were bachelors all their lives . I recall visiting, but was
            never allowed in the house . They were rather eccentric, to say the least .

              Both Eddie and Jim McCall had a large interest in the Lyons
            sandstone quarries . They also had a ranch in the mountains where they
            raised cattle and cut timber . They were considered pretty well-to-do;
            they owned and operated the sandstone quarries that supplied all the
            stone used to build the Colorado State University campus in Boulder .
            All the sidewalks in Longmont were made of large slabs of sandstone,
            also from their mines .
              Uncle Eddie and Uncle Jim didn’t believe in banks, and according
            to my mother, they kept their money in a big bucket accessed through
            a hole in a closet floor covered with carpet . When the last one died,
            there was quite a race to see who got there first . Uncle Norton—always
            70]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[rather fleet of foot—and my mother were the first on the scene . Norton
              retrieved the bucket and placed it in the back of the car with a stern
              warning to my mother not to look . I have no idea how much money
              was involved! Stories of gold coins and other valuables floated around
              the family for years . Eventually, what Norton didn’t carry off was
              divided, with several thousand dollars going to the surviving family .
              Jimmy had a live-in lady friend who took care of him for many, many
              years, and I expect she was also rewarded well .

                So long ago . I always wished I had spent more time with my grand-
              parents, learning about the family .

                     Sunday Visits To Estes Park




              We always, and I mean ALWAYS, had to go to Estes on Sunday . Rain,
              snow, gloom or doom . I never heard my father protest . I expect that
              he knew better, even though he must have tired of that trip . When we
              first started, it was in a Model T Ford coupe with isinglass side curtains .
              Later, we graduated to bigger and more comfortable cars . I was always
              carsick, as the road was narrow and crooked . The exhaust gas suffocated
              me in the back seat . I went until I was old enough to be left home,
              but I still had to put in an appearance now and then to satisfy my
              grandmother .
                I never really felt comfortable with my uncles . Ted was four years
              older than me, and at that age, it was a huge gap . Norma was always
              there, but she was too quiet to be much of a companion . The older boys
              indulged in sibling rivalry, to the point that they nearly tore the house
              down wrestling and trying to best one another . Norton was always the
              ringleader; he pestered Harry and Ted to the point where they abso-
              lutely had to defend their honor .
                Byron and Corky came as close as any to being friends . They had a
              favorite huge rock between the house and the barn, where they chiseled
              out roads and played with their miniature cars and trucks .
                When we visited, I generally hung around the old folks . Granddad
              Billings always sat in a big throne-like chair with bear-claw feet and a
              carved back at one end of the living room . He seldom spoke—couldn’t
              compete with the women . He smoked a cigar occasionally . One end of
              the room opened out onto a small sunroom where it was comfortable
              to sit in the winter . The kitchen had a big wood and coal-burning


                                                                           79]]></page><page Index="90"><![CDATA[stove where many holiday feasts were prepared . There was an indoor
            restroom, which was a blessing, but it frequently froze up on the coldest
            nights . The living room had a huge coal-burning stove that managed
            to keep at least one room of the house comfortable . The house stood
            halfway up a sloping hill, so there was a view of the area out the front
            windows . It was surrounded by pine trees that sang in the summer
            breezes and shivered in the winter winds .

              In the summers, we all enjoyed picnicking under the pine trees . The
            grass grew tall and thick . The ground was littered with pine cones . The
            trees and the running water of a nearby stream were enough to lull you
            into a nap . It was grand to experience the drone of voices and a tummy
            full of fried chicken, or maybe homemade ice cream . The kids would
            climb the rocks and explore the running water in search of a stray
            rainbow trout . Those days and memories are irreplaceable .

                    Thanksgiving and Christmas

                               with the Billings





              Every Thanksgiving and Christmas was a Billings affair . The Lee family
              played very little part in this family activity . Thanksgiving was spent in
              Estes Park, while Christmas was in Hygiene and later in Longmont .

                On Thanksgiving, the rule was that everyone drew names out of a
              hat . You were expected to buy a gift of some kind for this person, with
              one dollar being the top limit . Generally, I had one dollar for my entire
              family, so my lucky recipient couldn’t look forward to a whole lot . My
              favorite gift for Grandma Billings was a washcloth and a bar of soap .
              She always said that she could tell what she would get if I got her name .
              There was much recycling of gifts at Christmas . Some of the neckties
              for the men made the rounds for years and years . If you didn’t use the
              gift received, you carefully saved it to give to someone the following
              Christmas . We all received these gifts, trying not to show that we had
              seen it before . There was always lots of laughter, joking, and generally
              lots of fun on these holidays .

                Dad had an old Model A Ford pickup truck he drove on his job . A
              few days before Christmas, we would pile into the truck and drive into
              the mountains in search of a Christmas tree . Generally, he had an area
              picked out . We would wade through deep snow—sometimes across
              the frozen river—and saw down a tree . Mother popped corn, and we
              would string it on thread to decorate the tree . Sometimes, we strung red
              cranberries for a contrasting color . I can’t remember lights on the tree,
              as candles were very dangerous to use . It stood in the living room until
              its needles began to make a carpet on the carpet .
                                                                           81]]></page><page Index="92"><![CDATA[Chapter 20:
                                Fourth of July




            This narration would not be complete without a mention of the Fourth
            of July . Next to Christmas, this was the most important day of the year .
            Jim and I would go to Longmont for our fireworks . Lutes Drug Store
            stood on the northeast corner of 4  and Main Street . They would fill
                                          th
            their display windows full of fireworks of all sorts and sizes, from big
            three-inch cannon crackers to lady fingers . Cherry bombs, sky rockets
            and sparklers were everywhere . A single lit match in that display would
            have blown up that whole end of town . We could buy a large grocery
            bag full for a dollar . In addition to factory built fireworks, we manufac-
            tured some of our own using carbide and a bit of water .
              Jennie had an old pressure cooker that we liberated for our purposes .
            These old cookers were probably manufactured from aluminum . The
            top was held down by several turnbuckle affairs that screwed the lid
            down tight . A pressure gauge, calibrated in pounds, set atop the lid .
            A relief valve for regulating the inner pressure was next to the gauge .
            Ordinarily, the food and a quantity of water were placed in the cooker
            and you would have a tender meal in short order . The pressure was kept
            from climbing too high by opening the relief valve slightly .

              We modified this process somewhat by placing a quantity of carbide
            and a bit of water in the cooker . Water and carbide form an inflamma-
            ble gas of considerable power . By placing a small rubber hose over the
            relief valve we could regulate a bit of gas into the end of our carbide
            cannon . Open the valve, close the valve, light off the cannon . Man, what
            a boom! We had a spark plug in the end of the cannon—an old ford
            ignition coil and battery provided the fuse to ignite the propellant . By

              cannon pipe, you could blow a projectile clear out of sight .
                We made handheld projectile launchers from heavy lead pipes . One
              end was hammered shut so the considerable force from an exploding
              fire cracker would be directed out the far end . By assuming a comfort-
              able position in an apple tree across the lane from the pig pen, we could
              harass them until our ammunition ran out . Pow, squeal, reload and
              shoot again . I wonder why Percy allowed us to do this!
                On Fourth of July night, we fired off our roman candles and sky
              rockets over Birch Lake . What a magnificent sight and a fit ending to a
              perfect day .
                In addition to the fireworks, the 4  was also a day the Lee clan
                                             th
              gathered for a celebration, consisting of me, Aunt Amy, Uncle George
              and family, my mother and father, and Granddad Lee and Minnie .
              Clyde and family were always away in Idaho . Sometimes we would
              picnic down near the lake under some huge cottonwood trees—plenty
              of room for the kids to play ball and tease the girls .

                There was always a big, huge freezer of ice cream that we had made
              earlier in the day . An old gunny sack was placed over the freezer and
              one kid sat on the freezer to hold it down while another turned the
              crank . When it was absolutely impossible to turn it another round,
              Jennie would announce that it was done . The paddle was removed with
              care, so as not to allow any salty water into the ice cream . The top was
              placed back on and ice packed over it again . Sometimes there were
              strawberries frozen in it, but we generally just liked plain vanilla . Each
              of us got one or two spoonfuls of ice cream from the paddle then had to
              wait until later for the big bowl .

                              Sunday School




            I should mention our religious affiliation as it was a part of our young
            lives . When I was quite young, I recall going to Sunday School at the
            Methodist Church in Hygiene . I don’t think my parents were particu-
            larly attached to any church . In fact, I don’t believe any of the Lees were
            too excited about going to Church .
              One day, when I was maybe five years old, I saw Minnie running
            down the road toward our house . She had a bible in her hand and was
            extremely excited . She had been introduced to a religion that promised
            to fulfill her needs: the Christian Science Church . For the uninitiated,
            they believe that our physical ills can be cured by ardent prayer—not
            that much different from others I expect .
              The Church was located in Longmont next to a pretty green city
            park . It was small, but large enough to serve the congregation . Minnie
            and Jennie were the first to succumb . Since Jennie was going, Jim went
            to Sunday School . And since he was going to Sunday School, I had to go
            to Sunday School . And since Jim and I were going, Dorothy and Stella
            Rose had to go too . Amy soon joined them, so it was pretty much a
            family affair . My parents were neither here nor there on the subject .
              The Church had a Reader who stood at a podium in front of the
            congregation, reading selected passages from the Bible . An outline
            and guide were provided by the Mother Church based in Boston . Each
            congregation member was provided with a small booklet that contained
            the outline for the weekly lesson . During the week, you would read the
            Bible passages recommended, and then on Sunday it was repeated and
            expanded on by the Reader . It was sort of fun . We had a guided tour of

              written in .
                This church provided Minnie with the companionship and well-be-
              ing she enjoyed the rest of her life . She read her Bible every day as did
              Jennie, Amy and Dorothy . The rest of us fell by the wayside as we grew
              older .

                                 Fall Harvest




            During early summers, Uncle Percy allowed Jim and I to hoe the corn
            field . We were paid a dollar a day, provided we put in a good six or
            more hours . Of course, there was still the twice-a-day milking and
            other regular chores thrown in .
              At harvest time, Jim drove the team of horses pulling a big grain
            wagon . We pulled up next to the thresher for a load . When full, we then
            drove next to the granary and shoveled the grain into a small window
            far above our head . Neither one of us was much of a muscle man, so
            it was a real back-breaking job . Dinner break found us famished and
            pooped .

              During threshing season, neighbors pooled their resources helping
            one another until all had their crops in . Several would bring teams
            pulling big wagons that were used to haul the bundles of wheat from
            the field to the threshing machine . This was long before the combine
            was invented .
              The power source for running the thresher was a huge Rumley
            steam engine tractor . The rear wheels were far above my head . It huffed,
            puffed, and blew steam and black smoke all day long . A drive belt
            connected the engine to the thresher . The belt was about twelve inches
            wide and maybe thirty feet long . It was twisted once, in the center, to
            keep it from working itself off the drive . Jim and I soon figured out that
            this would make an excellent source of static electricity for our enter-
            tainment . By using something like a five gallon glass jar lined inside and
            out with tin foil, we manufactured a huge capacitor . By locating it close
            to the belt, the jar absorbed a static charge . When it was fully charged,


            86]]></page><page Index="97"><![CDATA[we could short the tin foil plates together and get a tremendous spark .
              By attaching the foil plates to upright wires, we could generate a series
              of lightning flashes between the wires as the plates charged and dis-
              charged . The whole place had the odor of corona . Unfortunately, the
              horses were spooked—and the neighbors were not too receptive either .
                Dinner for the threshing crew was served in a grub wagon . This was
              a long wagon with a canvas top and screened sides . A long table ran
              down the center of the wagon with benches on either side . I expect
              it would accommodate 20 or more people—all of whom would be
              starved . Aunt Jennie would host the feast while they were on her farm,
              and would provide all the food . Other neighbor ladies would assist her
              in the preparation . Never have you seen a spread like they would lay
              out . Fried chicken piled high on platters, mashed potatoes and gravy,
              hot biscuits with fresh churned butter, sweet corn, green beans, peas .
              Freshly baked bread with honey and preserves, watermelon, apple pie
              and cookies .  It makes me hungry just writing about it! The harvest only
              lasted a few days, and then it would be on to the next farm .

                During the fall, when the corn became mature, it was time to fill the
              silo . This was not one of my favorite activities, but the pay was good: all
              you could eat and a dollar a day . My job was to climb up into the silo (as
              the ground silage was blown in from the top), and stomp it down tight
              against the sides so there would be no air holes . Jim ran the grinder and
              Percy hauled in the corn .
                During haying season, which actually lasted all summer, we worked
              and sweated in the hot sun . Jim drove the hay rake, dumping the hay on
              the hay stacker forks . My job was to lead the stacker horse out and back
              as the loads of hay were thrown up and over onto the stack . Uncle Percy
              worked the stack with a pitchfork, placing the hay here and there so the
              stack would stand straight and not tumble down around our ears . This
              was dull work considering that we were unable to speak to one another
              all day long . Aunt Jennie would bring our lunch out to us . We would sit
              in the shade of the stack, eating and resting . When we came in at the
              end of the day, we rode on the backs of the horses . Their backs were so
              wide, you could hardly straddle them, and we felt so high in the air that
              it seemed like we were riding elephants!




                                                                           87]]></page><page Index="98"><![CDATA[After the first frost came in October, it was time to pick the corn ears
            off the stalks . The stalks were dried and rustled in the breeze all day .
            The team of horses walked slowly up the corn rows with no direction
            from us . We walked beside the wagon and threw the ears of corn into
            the wagon . Shortly after we started in the mornings, it was warm
            enough to remove our jackets and the sun felt wonderful on our backs .
            We talked and wondered and dreamed the day away . How could life be
            more wonderful?

              About November, but before the snow fell, it was time to cut the
            winters supply of firewood . Generally, a big cottonwood tree near the
            lake was sacrificed . Many times it was a tree that had been the victim
            of multiple lightning strikes, so it was dead and its wood dry . We
            used a long saw with a handle on each end . Back and forth, spilling
            wood chips as it went . Soon, lengths of six feet or so were laying on
            the ground . We hoisted these onto the wagon . If they were too large
            and heavy, we just drug them back to the farmyard with a chain . Even
            the horses seemed to enjoy this fall activity under a beautiful blue sky,
            where maybe a white cloud would float by . The ducks would fly over
            and land on the lake, and the birds would sing a tune for us . There was
            a very big circular sawblade mounted on a structure of some kind that
            we used to cut the wood into the proper length . It was then necessary
            to split the wood and pile it in a dry place . Sometimes we used a wedge
            and heavy sledgehammer; other times an ax sufficed . It takes good eye
            and muscle control to strike a piece of firewood in the same place twice
            with an ax . Same with cutting off the head of a chicken; don’t whack
            him in the nose or cut too far back on the body .

              Once the corn was shelled from the cobs, it was piled somewhere to
            keep dry . Dry cobs make a fast fire and a good starter for not-so-dry
            wood . The corn cobs burned with a peculiar pungent odor, smelled
            quite sweet, and always thereafter reminded me of the fall of the year,
            which has always been my favorite time—a time when outside work
            was no longer expected of you, and Jim and I could retire to the “lab-or-
            a-tory” and see what we could blow up .  I recall those days fondly, and
            consider them probably some of the best of my entire life .

              In the years following his retirement, Oliver and his wife Rowena
              traveled the country in their little camper—then larger and even larger
              RVs!—visiting the Pacific Coast and the Southwest, eventually settling
              in Camp Verde, Arizona .
                Along the way, Oliver developed the craft of model ship building,
              taking on the most challenging form of the hobby—scale models of the
              wooden-hulled, tall-masted ships that sailed the Great Lakes in the 19
                                                                           th
              century . His highly-detailed models of these legendary ships were often
              built from scratch, taking two years to complete .
                In 2006, Oliver and Rowena visited a friend in Cedaredge, Colorado
              and liked it so much, they packed their bags and returned to Colorado .
              Cedaredge proved to be a good fit: Every morning, Oliver walked the
              apple orchards near his home in Cedaredge . On hot afternoons, he
              drove up into the mountains to enjoy the cool breezes . He made a lot of
              good friends there who were also amateur radio operators .

                Today, Oliver continues to operate his Ham radio, connecting with
              friends and participating in Hamfests around the country . With each
              move and duty assignment, his call sign changed, but not his enthusi-
              asm for radio .
                In January 2020, Oliver celebrated his 85th year as a ham .  The
              Amateur’s Code, the creed by which all Ham radio operators aspire,
              extols the virtues of “Considerate, Loyal, Progressive, Friendly,
              Balanced and Patriotic .” Oliver’s life as a Ham emulates the best of these
              values .
                Oliver Edward Lee entered this world on June 21, 1920 . From
              country boy to serviceman, communications officer, teacher, and father,
              grandfather, and beyond! His memoir represents an amazing glimpse
              into the life of a special person . We’re grateful to Oliver for sharing his
              story .
                W0LCI, thanks for the call.

                          “Master Ship Builder”



                                   November 10, 2010
                             Delta County Independent
                        Story and Photos by Bob Borchardt






























              During the early years of the 19  century the United States, fed up at
                                         th
              the British navy’s haughtiness and with disagreements over shipping
              and dtrade on the high seas, declared war on Great Britain on June 18,
              1812 . Sometimes referred to as the “Second War of Independence,” and
              the “forgotten war,” the War of 1812 lasted for a little more than two
              years . It was a time of tall ships, powered by sail, which has captured
              the imaginations of many over the years, including Oliver Lee of
              Cedaredge .

                                                                           93]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[Oliver, one of two sons
            born to Clarence and
            Villa Lee, was born in
            1920 in the small town
            of Hygiene, Colo . At the
            age of 15, Oliver learned
            Morse Code; earned
            a HAM radio license;
            and spent three years in
            the Colorado National
            Guard before graduating from Longmont High School in 1938 . He
            attended the University of Colorado, and later, amidst rumors of
            war, Oliver joined the Navy Reserve . In 1940, he joined the Navy as a
            radio and radar technician on a minesweeper, serving in such venues
            as Guadacanal, Iwo Jima, the Philippines and Japan . He and his wife
            Rowena moved to Cedaredge four years ago . Sadly, Rowena passed
            away earlier this year .
              Now, a retired naval ofﬁcer, Oliver is fascinated by the tall ships that
            sailed the Great Lakes and fought in the War of 1812 . So much so, that
            he has spent the last 13 years building scale models of some of those
            ships . He explained that when he quit smoking he needed something
            to do and that he likes to work with his hands . He said it takes about to
            years to build one of these models .
              He also researches the history of those ships . Oliver has built eight
            models of those now legendary “tall” ships of that era, and is currently
            working on a scale modle of the U .S . Brig Syren .
              Commissioned in September 1803, Oliver explained that although
            the Syren was not a pirate ship, it was a faster, smaller ship than the
            British ships and more maneuverable, built to raid the British merchant
            ships . The Syren was captured by the Royal Navy in 1814 .
              Oliver noted that once a model is built, he tends to lose interest .
            Although they are not for sale, he has given several away to friends and
            family . Oliver builds his models either from scratch or kits, noting that
            it is “hard to ﬁnd the hardware you need if you’re building them from
            scratch .”




            94]]></page><page Index="105"><![CDATA[Oliver explained that the ﬁrst step in building a scale model is the
              same as in building the real thing — the laying of the keel, and making
              sure that it is square and straight . In nautical terms, the keel is a large
              beam around which the hull of the ship/model is formed . The keel runs
              down the middle of the ship and is the foundation and major source for
              the structural strength of the hull . For his part, Oliver also uses braces
              that he designed to ensure the strength of the hull .

                According to Oliver, after the keel and the braces are laid, the rest of
              the ship goes together, using double planked bass wood with no grain
              for the hull, brass ﬁttings, copper, rope and other woods like cherry and
              mahogany for their grain . Oliver said the tools he uses include a small
              table saw built for model construction; various blades in the Exacto
              series of hand cutters; various sized drill bits and a hand-held drill;
              lots of sandpaper; small squares and supports to keep ship’s bulkheads
              square with the keel (according to Oliver, this is the most important
              part of building as the entire ship depends on the integrity of the keel
              and bulk- heads); a small drill press; a small jig saw; and many small
              clamps, includ- ing clothes pins, used when gluing parts to hull .

                Oliver noted that each part of
              the model requires a completely
              different process . “That keeps it
              from getting monotonous,” he
              laughed . “Tying the knots and
              putting the rigging in is tedious,”
              he added . He also builds the
              display cases for the model ships
              he builds . “They are just as much
              work as building the ship,” said Oliver .
                In his home ofﬁce, Oliver proudly has on display a model of the U .S .

              Great Lakes from the British during the War of 1812 . Following the
              capture of the British ships, Commodore Perry sent his now famous
              message, “We have met the enemy and they are ours…”

                After being scuttled and three reconstructions later, the Niagara

              Another one of his models, “The Pride of Baltimore,” is proudly on
            dis- play at the home of friends, Andy and Carole Robertson .
              The Pride of Baltimore was an authentic full-sized reproduction
            of a 19th century Baltimore clipper com- missioned by citizens of
            Baltimore . It was lost at sea with four of its 12 crew on May 14, 1986 .
              The Pride of Baltimore II, a replica commissioned in 1988 to replace
            the Pride of Baltimore, now sails as a Goodwill Ambassador from
            Baltimore and the State of Maryland .
              Andy Robertson, who helped Oliver with the building of the model,
            said it took them more than 800 hours to complete . Andy, noting that
            Oliver is 90 years old and has arthritis in his right hand said, “He is
            amazing and his hands are steady .” Andy concluded, “I’ve built a lot of
            models, airplanes, etc ., but they’re all child’s play compared to this .”]]></page><page Index="107"><![CDATA[Oliver and Byron Lee visiting at Oliver’s home in Cedaredge, June 21, 2010

               Oliver E. Lee began life in the small town of Hygiene, CO, in             THIS IS W9 ZED EYE WY, PLEASE COME IN: A MEMOIR BY OLIVER EDWARD LEE
               1920. Over the next 99 years, he would develop a passion for
               amateur  radio, serve around  the world in multiple wars as a
               RADAR and  communications expert,  raise  3 children  and
               celebrate the arrival of many grandchildren and great-grandchil-
               dren, and travel across the country extensively.

               As he prepares to celebrate his centennial birthday, we—his
               family—have compiled this memoir as a tribute to his life, his
               service to his country, and always, his passion for HAM radio.
